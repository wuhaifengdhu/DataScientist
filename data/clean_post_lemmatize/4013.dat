at netflix don't deal huge scale deal huge diversity scale. we run thousand application back-end cloud systems. we serve hundred thousand tv show movie million customer across million device distributed across thousand device family constantly evolving changing.
the real-time analytics group netflix build system continuously use diverse telemetry source within environment sift million signal arrive actionable high-confidence decision what's going environment it. some work we've already talked publicly would like open-source includes
1. noticing one thousand server misbehaving based outlier detection automatically replacing new server
2. automatically detecting whether new code deployed production least performant correct baseline code either accelerating deployment globally rolling back
3. automatically monitoring health application alerting user application skews normal behavior. for detail take look talk aws invent.
we see huge opportunity using rta decision drive automated system improve ecosystem's self-healing capability also make easier engineer understand what's important look automatically deduce correlation causation notice minute imperceptible change streaming environment customer do.
our analytics engineer build model take advanced statistical analysis approach machine learning technique provide recommendation many case make decisive automated action managing production environment. if extracting meaning whole lot data aka noise fascinating talk. if like deducing understanding control system pattern definitely talk.
