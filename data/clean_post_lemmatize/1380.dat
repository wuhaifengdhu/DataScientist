at civis looking great software engineer particular expertise front end development. our front end engineers responsible user interface visualization data science product often found working highest velocity projects. we rely front end engineer combine science beauty function ensure clean user experience.
what's great front end engineer civis we believe ownership work continuous learning run team reinforce values.
we trust engineer team pick right architecture library framework job hand. they help make decision new product cross-functional design sprint take quarterly hack week try new idea new technologies. civis engineer push code production second day work project chosen gain responsibility right away.
we want never stop learning. everyone mentor day one track personal development alongside technical deliverables. we staff project based people learn know best today. engineers collaborate across department data scientist analyst best brightest field also eager teach learn you. finally valuing continuous learning also mean recognizing strongest contributor stand capability credentials.
