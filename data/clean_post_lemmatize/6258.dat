monsanto's mission centered developingagricultural solution sustainable future include globalpopulation projected eclipse 9.6 billion 2050. we approach agricultureholistically looking across broad range solution using biotechnologyand plant breeding produce best possible seed advanced predictiveand prescriptive analytics designed select best possible crop system forevery acre.
to make possible monsanto collect terabytesof data across aspect operation genome sequencing cropfield trial manufacturing supply chain everything between. there isan enormous need potential something never donebefore. we need great big data engineers help transform complex scientificdatasets innovative software deployed across pipeline accelerating pace quality crop system development decision tounbelievable levels.
