        Sr. Director, Data Analytics
        Senior Director, Data Analytics
        At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we were a tiny startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and that little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.
        Twenty-five years after Capital One was started it's still led by its founder. Be ready to join a community of the smartest people you've ever met, who put the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.
        As a Senior Director, Data Analytics within Enterprise Model Risk, Analytics, and Data (EMRAD), you will shape and lead a new team in the validation of business impacting analytical tools. You will enhance your strategic technical and analytical skills, while also working closely with business leaders across Capital One to influence business strategy.
