           Sr. Data Scientist
            The Role:
           We are looking for a motivated data analyst to help us advance different functions in remanufacturing team. The ideal candidate is self-driven, excited to learn new technologies, and interested in solving challenging problems.
           The main role will be to use different types of data gathered from our test equipment and fleet of vehicles to diagnose different failures. The candidate will work on our state-of-the-art equipment and design machine learning algorithms to automate and enhance our diagnosis process and remanufacturing process.
            Responsibilities:
            Design and implement scalable algorithms and data models that automate our diagnosis and remanufacturing process
            Design and implement big data workflows using Python, SQL, Hadoop, Spark, Matlab and R
            Devise visualization, debugging, and simulation tools for validation
            Work with a cross-functional team of hardware engineers, process engineers, software engineers, QA/Validation, designers, and technicians
            Requirements:
            Strong analytical and programming skills with a solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, modeling and software design
            Experience with big data frameworks such as Hadoop/Spark and SQL
            Proficiency in Python and experience with data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn
            Proficiency in major numerical software such as Matlab and R.
            Proficiency in in web development such as Django, Javascript, and various frameworks
            Some IT knowledge, such as task management/monitoring and virtual machine management
            Some knowledge of Unix/Linux environments and version control systems (e.g. Git)
            High standards for code quality, maintainability, testing, and performance
