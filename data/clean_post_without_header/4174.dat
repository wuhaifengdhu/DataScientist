        Data Scientist Manager - Search
        The backbone of Airbnb's business is its search model - a sophisticated product that aims to match guests and hosts for a given trip. It is a problem that combines online and offline worlds in a way that few other businesses have exposure to, which presents unique challenges in analysis, measurement and personalization. Airbnb's recent expansion to new trip verticals -- experiences, places and others to come -- presents our search team with a new set of challenges in optimizing search for these new domains and in creating a unified search experience across these verticals.
        We're seeking a proven data science leader excited about experimentation, analytics, mining user behavior data and machine learning to work on Airbnb's biggest challenges. You will lead a large team focused on measuring and analyzing search patterns on Airbnb's, building machine learning models to boost conversion and creating a delightful search experience for our users. As a leader, you will set best practices, architect solutions, design processes and build a team that will grow at a fast clip. You'll partner with engineering and product executives to design strategy and vision for search at Airbnb.
