        What You'll Do
        You will leverage in-depth sector and client expertise to lead teams, manage projects, and present results to clients.
        You'll lead performance benchmarking programs by leveraging industry insights to ensure timeliness, relevance, and effectiveness and you'll develop client deliverables to ensure the highest possible quality, including management reports with key insights and quantified recommendations.
        You will have the opportunity to manage analyst teams with responsibility for coaching, developing and improving the team's capability and overall delivery. In addition, you will establish and maintain key client relationships throughout and beyond the benchmarking cycle to drive client satisfaction and strengthen Energy Insights' networks across the industry.
        You will present results to clients independently or in partnership with McKinsey colleagues and you'll also help to plan and facilitate client workshops including preparing materials in addition to synthesizing and delivering the final report.
        Additionally, you will develop and contribute to external thought leadership articles covering relevant oil and gas industry themes and trends and provide input to and lead the implementation of service line improvement initiatives, such as development of new client services. Furthermore, you'll apply industry and functional expertise to McKinsey consulting projects as part of the delivery team - either supporting the project with a benchmarking component or more broadly in a consulting role.
        You'll have the opportunity to gain new skills and build on the strengths you bring to the firm and will receive exceptional training as well as frequent coaching and mentoring from colleagues on your teams.
