        Mission
        As a data specialist, your focus will be on mobile medical devices, very large multivariate clinical datasets and real-world data (e.g. medical claims). Working at the NIBR global headquarters in Cambridge, MA, you'll be part of Translational Medicine, NIBR and Novartis' commitment to change clinical practice for the better by leveraging modern technologies and analytics to improve how we quantify patient disease phenotypes. Acting as a point of contact for clinical trial teams enabling them to leverage device-derived data within their studies, and where clinical needs are unmet by current methodology, work in close collaboration with analysts and data engineers to develop novel methods and software for data ingestion, integration, analysis and visualization.
        Key Responsibilities
        1.Provide support to clinical trial teams, and consulting expertise to other project teams, working with digital mobile health devices
        a.Help advise on the selection of devices and provide guidance on implementation (data ingestion, integration and analysis)
        b.Ensure study design matches needs of the team
        c.Integrate with other clinical data sources and execute exploratory analysis and reporting
        2.Contribute to and/or drive the development of new analytic methods in collaboration with internal NIBR/Development groups or external groups where existing practice is not sufficient to meet clinical need
        a.Contribute to the team helping to address those unmet needs
        b.Act as collaborative interface to other data expertise groups (engineering, analysis, etc.)
        3.Contribute to/help to define best practices for implementation of streaming/real-time/digital devices into studies
        4.Maintain expertise in best practises for data handling especially as it applies to "big data" (data warehousing, data integration, archiving, scalable analysis solutions etc.)
        5.Contribute to/help to implement an infrastructure that enables the TM real-time/digital device vision in close collaboration with NIBR/Development IT
        6.Independently seek out new sources of data that could be leveraged for TM/BMD needs EEO Statement The Novartis Group of Companies are Equal Opportunity Employers and take pride in maintaining a diverse environment.
