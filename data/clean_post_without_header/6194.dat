        At Monsanto, we're committed to helping the world's farmers produce more while using fewer resources. Achieving this goal requires innovation and new technology to re-imagine agriculture. We're looking for a talented individual with a passion for discovery and science. Are you ready to join a team where your skills and ideas can help farmers provide the food, fuel and clothing that the growing world needs?
        The pathology team conducts research on the epidemiology and biology of major crop diseases, develops assays for gauging plant genetic resistance to pathogens and evaluates breeding germplasm for resistance to disease. The discovery breeding team seeks new breeding methodologies, product concepts and new traits for use in product development.
        This co-op placement will provide an opportunity to conduct research that will help protect crops from major agricultural diseases. The co-op student will be part of an interdisciplinary team and will interact with discovery breeders, pathologists, statistical geneticists and data scientists. You will conduct an independent research project with the opportunity to develop ideas, conduct and document experiments and communicate results in reports and presentations.
        You will be part of a research community and will be expected to participate in site activities and follow safety guidelines. You will gain practical research experience in an innovative and results focused company. It is hoped that this experience will inform further career choices and provide an opportunity to develop skills.
        This role requires a six (6) month commitment.
        Please apply only if you are certain of your willingness and ability to commit to the full duration of the assignment for the fall or spring semester (Jan-June or June-Dec) of 2017.
