        Expedia
        Are you excited about solving real world problems with advanced machine learning methods?
        Expedia is looking for a machine learning scientist/practitioner to join the core data science team that builds data centric features for the Expedia websites (Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Wotif and others). Our mission spans many areas that are core to our business, including search and sort, referral marketing, revenue management and geography. Your work will impact millions of our customers and will have a direct impact on our business results.
        The main focus of your job will be in developing state of the art machine learning algorithms to power highly complex global marketing campaigns, which include search engine marketing, retargeting and brand advertising. Our challenges include deriving value from sparse data, understanding and participating in large scale auctions and leveraging behavioral data for segmentation, personalization and more.
        Expedia has deep and rich data sets, many still untapped, and your passion for the craft of statistics and machine learning has the power to unlock tangible growth for our business. We are looking for someone with hands on experience building machine learning models, either in an academic or industrial setting. You should have an advanced degree (PhD preferred) in machine learning / computer science or other quantitative discipline. Applicants from outside the machine learning field will be expected to demonstrate equivalent knowledge. Those who have done well in Kaggle competitions (especially ours) will be given special consideration.
