        Roche Sequencing Solutions Santa Clara, is a fast moving, highly technical team of people with the ambitious goal of disrupting Next Generation DNA Sequencing. Our technology fuses active biological and solid state elements to bring single molecule based sequence detection to scale. Developing this unique platform requires expertise across a range of fields: Software Engineering, Data Science, Information Theory, Biophysics, Biology, Chemistry, Protein Engineering, Digital and Analog Circuit Design, and Electrochemistry, just to name a few.
        As a Senior Data Scientist in the System Integration Assay Team, you will have the opportunity to work with experts in each of these fields, all of whom are focused on the common goal of bringing our sequencing platform to market. Your role will be to help analyze and interpret sequencing results to further enhance the performance of the sequencing instrument. This will require a deep understanding of how our technology works, and will entail using skills from several of the scientific disciplines listed above.
        Responsibilities:
        * Perform statistical analysis of sequencing data to determine the effect of changing sequencing parameters
        * Create novel analysis pipelines to quantify the prevalence and duration of various sequencing signals
        * Develop and implement mathematical algorithms using Python for data mining, analysis, and to quantify sequencing performance using various parameters and metrics.
        * Debug software issues to create a robust platform
        * Become an expert on the operation of the Genia Single Molecule Sequencing Platform
        * Assist lab personnel by customizing analysis codes to understand system performance
        * Who you are
        You're someone who wants to influence your own development. You're looking for a company where you have the opportunity to pursue your interests across functions and geographies. Where a job title is not considered the final definition of who you are, but the starting point.
