        Cerner Technology Services (CTS) is a fast growing, critical organization to Cerner's success. As Cerner's internal hosting, managing, and monitoring organization for infrastructure as well as internal and cloud applications and services, we are the frontline of Cerner's IT footprint responsible for multiple levels of service and infrastructure availability, security, and disaster recovery while simultaneously providing superior performance, reliability, and scalability at optimal financial commitment levels. We enable Cerner and client health care organizations to achieve their business outcomes by leveraging the most sophisticated and powerful IT solutions available today through our state-of-the-art data centers and cloud brokerage.
        As a data scientist working with Cerner Technology Services and Enterprise Data Management you will work on challenging, top-tier problems originating from a wide spectrum of internal business and IT use cases and processes. Creativity, communication skills, a drive for learning, and flexibility towards both problem spaces and statistical methodologies characterize the successful candidate who will join this team.
        You will be challenged to extract insight from structured and unstructured data to inform the problem at hand through successful collaboration and innovation with business subject matter experts, process owners, and IT data engineering teams. Becoming versed in relevant business glossary and contextual processes, you will potentially engineer data extraction from internal and external sources, evaluate the data's relevance to and reflection of the business and problem setting, and select and apply appropriate feature engineering, statistical, and machine learning techniques and treatments to develop and evaluate several models. At a minimum you will add documented insight to the problem space and tractability of the selected approaches; at a performant level you will create and deploy statistical models that provide novel insights, predictions, and actionable feature levers and/or targets that the business may use to optimize outcomes.
        Key responsibilities
        * Apply modern data storage, movement, and transformation architectures and techniques to extract and engineer features from any scale structured or unstructured data
        * Iteratively select and apply modern statistical and machine learning techniques and evaluation methods to engineered features to derive a best candidate model
        * Communicate implications, limitations, dependencies, and other deployment guidelines of a model or data analysis result at all levels â€“ executive decision maker, end user, and technical audiences
        * Work within a modern software or analytic development lifecycle methodology as appropriate to the problem and business owner, to include collaboration with engineering teams to deploy a model/algorithmic discovery into another platform and/or language when architecturally necessary
        * Drive strategic-level business planning through rapid prototyping, data-driven research proposals, and/or demonstrations
        * Create appropriate visualizations to articulate a data story
        * Independently manage significant issues and projects of a unique nature
        * Review literature, white papers, vendor announcements, etc. to stay aware of key data science, data engineering, machine learning, and predictive modeling techniques, methods, platforms, etc.
