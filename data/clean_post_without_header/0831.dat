        There are three reasons why the strategically hungry come to Brooklyn's Big Spaceship: to break free from thinking-by-department, to get closer to making, and to work with clients striving to recalibrate their businesses.
        We believe how you do makes what you do. That's why we sit in teams, not departments. That's why we have values, not rules. That's why we discuss our personal aspirations for projects before they start. If we can get it right on the inside – for our clients and our own company – then we believe our focus on solving business problems by solving human problems will thrive.
