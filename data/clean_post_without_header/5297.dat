        Duolingo is the world's largest online language learning service. Our apps were selected by Apple as "iPhone App of the Year", and by Google as "Best of the Best for Android," 2 years in a row. TechCrunch selected Duolingo as the Best Educational Startup in their annual awards. Unlike other online education platforms, Duolingo is a completely digital experience, meaning it requires constant interaction and is native to computers / mobile platforms.
        Duolingo is a spinoff from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. Luis von Ahn, co-founder and CEO of Duolingo, is a MacArthur fellow, Carnegie Mellon University professor, and the inventor of CAPTCHA. Duolingo was founded by engineers and is run by engineers. We hire ambitious people from various technical backgrounds who enjoy solving some of the world's most fascinating technological problems and improving education levels on a global scale. About 35% of our engineering team holds a PhD in computer science or a related field. In April 2016, Andrew Moore, CMU Computer Science Dean joined Duolingo's board.
        In the last three years, Duolingo has received US$83 million of funding from some of the premier venture capital firms in the country, including Union Square Ventures (investors of Twitter, Kickstarter, Foursquare, Tumblr), New Enterprise Associates (investors of Vonage, Silicon Graphics, Box), Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers (investors of Google, Amazon, Electronic Arts, America Online, Compaq, Sun), and Google Capital.
