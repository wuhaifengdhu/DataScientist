          About the Job
             The data science group here is not like those at other companies. We generate and process massive amounts of sequencing data on a system designed and built in-house from the ground up. As a Bioinformatics Data Scientist at Roche Sequencing Santa Clara, you will design and analyze experiments to drive development of our sequencing technology and apply it to a wide range of applications. The successful candidate must be excited about learning new concepts from both life and physical sciences and applying them to an interdisciplinary project.
             The majority of the time will be spent designing and analyzing experiments to better understand DNA sequencing experiments. This involves isolating specific components of the system as well as seeing how different combinations behave, with an eye on making the output as useful as possible for the different use cases (research, clinical, etc.). You will also be responsible for updating, maintaining and testing portions of our automated analysis pipeline.
               Responsibilities
             Design and analyze statistical experiments with various groups to better characterize DNA sequencing process
             Design metrics and reports to summarize complex trends in performance of sequencing
             Improve and maintain bioinformatics and main analysis pipeline
             Quickly write scripts to automate routine analysis tasks
             ·
             Experience with scientific programming (Python, Matlab, R, etc.) is a must
             ·
             Experience with analysis of high throughput biological data

              WHY WE'RE A GREAT COMPANY
             Genia’s mission is to make genetic information universally available. Our proprietary integrated circuits and NanoTag chemistry enable massively parallel single-molecule DNA sequencing. This versatile nanopore-based platform allows for single molecule, electrical, real-time analysis without the need for complicated optics, labels, amplification, or fluidics. By developing a true integrated circuit on standard semiconductor process technology, Genia’s sequencing platform enables the use of molecular diagnostics in everyday clinical care.
              With the 2014 acquisition, Genia Technologies is part of Roche Sequencing.
