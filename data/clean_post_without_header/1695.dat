        The Nanoscience and Technology (NST) Division at Argonne National Laboratory hosts the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM), a multidisciplinary user facility with expertise in the characterization, fabrication, synthesis and theory of nanoscale materials, in addition to performing programmatic science activities. NST research ranges from fundamental to use-inspired nanoscience with connections to industry and the Argonne applied science divisions. The division seeks to bring together scientists and engineers from national laboratories, industry, and academia to meet nanoscience and nanotechnology challenges of the present and future.
        We seek a staff scientist with expertise in the electron microscopy of nanoscale materials to join the Electron and X-ray Microscopy Group in the Nanoscience and Technology Division at Argonne.
        Position Requirements
        The staff scientist should possess a background in electron microscopy, and with a strong interest in the use of data science for electron microscopy research. He or she is expected to develop a world-class research program of his or her own in the area of electron microscopy of nanoscale materials, and is expected to collaborate effectively with other CNM scientists and users of the CNM. An interest and experience in applying data science techniques to electron microscopy would be an added plus. The staff scientist is also expected to have a strong commitment towards building up a robust set of users and collaborators for CNM's electron microscopy facilities. The position offers considerable research freedom and the ability to develop a long-term scientific research program.
        A Ph.D. in the physical sciences, with research experience in electron microscopy is required. Postdoctoral research experience is desirable.
