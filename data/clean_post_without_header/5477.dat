        Oracleis funding an internal initiative to enable collaboration and accelerateresearch around cancer. Our working title is ORACLE Cancer Research Cloud(OCRC). It is an extremely ambitious project that brings assets from across thecorporation to provide researchers a private area for them to conduct theirresearch. In exchange we will curate their data, anonymize it, and aggregate itinto a massive data warehouse that can be accessed by all the players in theecosystem (researchers in academic centers, pharma, payers, cliniciansproviding care, etc.). The intention of the initiative is to not onlyprovide the infrastructure to make research more efficient, but also to providethe means to improve patient outcomes based on the most current available research.
        DepartmentDescription:
        Ourteam will be driving the design, development, and delivery of the OCRC. We willbe at the cutting edge of data acquisition, integration and curation for alltypes of data necessary to support research, clinical, therapeutics, etc. Wewill leverage assets from inside and outside to company to ensure the bestoptions are available to our constituents.
