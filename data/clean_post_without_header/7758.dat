        Front-end Engineers are an essential part of Airbnb's Product Team. Working closely with designers, we implement the user interface of our web app. We build libraries and abstractions to make our lives easier, such as DLS, our front-end toolkit. We make the most of modern tools like React, ES6, and Redux, and even our next-generation mobile apps are built with JavaScript on React Native.
        In Portland, the Service Excellence team is building world-class tools for our global team of CX and Trust and Safety agents to ensure our guests and hosts have a great experience on Airbnb, 24/7, and 365 days a year.
