            • Conduct power analyses to determine required sample sizes
            • Develop and implement weighting protocols for complex surveys (including creation of replicate weights)
            • Perform model-based imputation
            • Implement quality control procedures, including nonresponse and mode effect analyses, quantification of nonresponse and non-coverage biases
