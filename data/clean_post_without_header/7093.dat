        DUTIES
        * analyze large volumes of data to build and enhance GEOINT products, processes, and systems. They conduct data mining and retrieval, and apply statistical and mathematical analyses to identify trends, solve analytical problems, optimize performance, and gather intelligence. They visualize information using a range of tools (e.g., GIS, R), develop scripts and algorithms, create explanatory and predictive models, and conduct comparative analyses to address complex military and intelligence problems. Knowledge of data science, methodologies, and processing techniques shall be employed on behalf of GEOINT analysts and community customers while providing operational support. The services provided shall include:
        * Applied knowledge in at least one of three distinct areas depending on mission requirements. General knowledge of all three areas required. These areas of knowledge include:
        o Applied Mathematics - Statistical and mathematical support to provide temporal and pattern analysis, correlation of events, probability analysis, assessments of sampling, analysis of variance and error, and regression testing and analysis.
        o Programming Skills - Write scripts in Visual Basic, Python or other software for modeling processes, repeatability, efficiency, knowledge capture, hypothesis testing and process automation.
        * Data Stories - Document and visualize data both temporally and spatially to assist in data Develop tradecraft techniques and solutions for discovery, preparation, manipulation and normalization of big data
        * Use mathematical concepts and techniques to solve complex GEOINT analysis issues and understand concepts associated with structured data and relational databases
        * Primary products will include presenting processed data, visualizations and scientific analysis to GEOINT analysts and managers in support of production, and providing Subject Matter Expert (SME) services in various forums
        * Interaction directly with NGA/ A GEOINT analyst customers as support requirements arise, and devise an optimal approach to processing and scientifically analyzing data in a timely manner given the available tools and techniques
        * Investigate new scientific analysis techniques and methods if requirements cannot be met in a timely manner with available tools and methods. This could include monitoring the community and industry for new technologies that can be inserted for operational use, or the near-term formulation of algorithms and applications
        * Explain assumptions, analytical techniques, and statistical results effectively in writing and orally to convey intelligence problems being resolved
        * Produce formal written reports of selected products which must conform to reporting standards ofNGAIA
        * Understand the relationship between the data collected for a real-world problem and the required structure of a relational database to help solve that problem
        * Understanding of deductive reasoning and implementation of the scientific method as it applies to GEOINT analysis
        o Integrity checks, ask the next question, and display analytical assessments.
