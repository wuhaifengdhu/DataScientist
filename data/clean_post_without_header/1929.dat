        DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
        * As a member of cross-functional project teams, work with partners to identify and exploit analytical opportunities, including experimental planning, design and analysis.
        * Apply rigorous statistical analysis, modeling, simulation, and predictive analytics to myriad experimental data sets and raise awareness of the value of various methodologies through education.
        * Propose new experiments and analytical processes to address novel questions that leverage Intrexon's technology platform for developing gene therapies, genetically modified cell therapies, tissues and mini-organs for regenerative medicine, and cell-based biomaterial manufacturing hosts for production of DNA, RNA, Protein, subcellular organelles, virus-like particles, viruses, and minicells.
        * Be a key partner in supporting Intrexon's genome engineering activities required for the development and characterization of cells employed.
        * Present findings to research partners by exposing their assumptions and validation work in a way that can be easily understood and leveraged by non-data scientists.
        * Gain insight into various therapeutics and diseases through the analyses of Next Generation Sequencing and various 'omics datasets.
        * Ability to develop data-driven hypotheses, generate insight and propose novel experimental ideas.
        * Prepare technical reports and make presentations to project teams, leadership, and other stakeholders.
        EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:
