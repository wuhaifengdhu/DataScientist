        Brookhaven National Laboratory is a multipurpose research institution funded primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. Located on the center of Long Island, New York, Brookhaven Lab brings world-class facilities and expertise to the most exciting and important questions in basic and applied scienceâ€”from the birth of our universe to the sustainable energy technology of tomorrow. We operate cutting-edge large-scale facilities for studies in physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, applied science, and a wide range of advanced technologies. The Laboratory's almost 3,000 scientists, engineers, and support staff are joined each year by more than 4,000 visiting researchers from around the world. Our award-winning history, including seven Nobel Prizes, stretches back to 1947, and we continue to unravel mysteries from the nanoscale to the cosmic scale, and everything in between. Brookhaven is operated and managed by Brookhaven Science Associates, which was founded by the Research Foundation for the State University of New York on behalf of Stony Brook University, and Battelle, a nonprofit applied science and technology organization.
        Position Description
        The Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN) is a user-oriented research center whose scientific program is focused on the understanding and exploitation of energy-related materials. The CFN maintains cutting-edge capabilities for material synthesis and characterization, and manages a computer cluster dedicated to nanoscience simulation and analysis. The CFN is a collaborative research environment, bringing together scientists with diverse expertise, including nanofabrication, electron microscopy, and theory & simulation. This position will also involve strong interaction with BNL's Computational Science Initiative, which is developing the next-generation hardware and software infrastructure necessary for demanding scientific data analysis.
        The focus of this position is the development of diverse data analysis methods and software targeted to nanoscience. The successful candidate will develop a portfolio of collaborations with CFN scientists and users, addressing pressing challenges in the acquisition, management, and analysis of scientific datasets. This work will involve interacting with domain scientists, learning about domain-specific data challenges, and developing physics-specific algorithms, analysis tools, and software codes to solve outstanding and important analysis challenges facing modern nanoscience. Software solutions will implement known and developed physics insights, through collaborations with CFN theorists and simulation tools. The successful candidate will both respond to domain-specific data challenges, and develop independent research ideas for improved scientific data analysis. The position presents an opportunity to develop unique and impactful tools to solve frontier problems in nanoscience and nanotechnology, leveraging the CFN's diverse set of data challenges and computation resources.
        Essential Duties and Responsibilities:
