        Department Overview
        The Energy Policy and Procurement (EPP) organizationprocures electricity, capacity, and ancillary services to serve the needs of bundled electric customers. In addition, EPP procures natural gas, pipeline capacity, and storage capacity on behalf of residential and small commercial customers, and for bothutility-owned and contracted third-party electric generation. EPP is responsible for the front-office and back-office functions associated with power and gas procurement. Front-office functions entail planning, contracting, trading, scheduling, and dispatchingelectricity and natural gas for PG&E's customers. Back-office functions entail administering procurement agreements and ensuring timely and accurate payments to the CAISO and third-party power and gas suppliers. EPP also actively participates in regulatory andlegislative proceedings that shape the design and implementation of state, regional, and federal energy regulation and policy. In addition, EPP is responsible for long-term planning, risk management, and compliance functions related to PG&E's energyportfolio.
        EPMA is a group within the Energy Policy and Procurement organization. At the moment, EPMA has nine professionals with advanced analytical degrees and significant energy and utility industry experience on the supply- and demand-sides. EPMA is aquantitative analysis team that develops short-term and long-term supply and demand models that support Energy Policy Procurement analytical needs including analysis focused on valuation of renewable and energy storage procurement via RFOs (Requests for Offers),cost-effectiveness assessments of energy assets (Hydro, nuclear, CCs, CTs, Natural Gas Storage, etc.). EPMA professionals provide data visualization analyses, Monte Carlo simulations for predictive analytics, operational and financial modelling of assetoptimization. EPMA is an internal consultant team that fosters collaboration while working on special projects involving intensive data-centric quantitative analysis and model building.
        Position Summary
        The Quantitative Analyst (Data ScientistFocused) will have demonstrated ability to effectively work collaboratively within fast-paced, multidisciplinary, analytical teams. The successful Quantitative Analyst will be a collaborative person who demonstrates the seven competencies embraced by PG&E: (1)puts safety first, (2) effectively communicates to seek provide clear respectful understanding, (3) takes proactive action to better serve and respect customers, (4) Takes accountability for results, (5) always acts with integrity and respects everyone, (6) embracesand furthers diversity and inclusion, and (7) has a passion for developing functional expertise and continuous improvement.
        The successful candidate will have experience processing "big-data", data management, and statistical/quantitative modeling ofsupply- and demand-side factors involving energy commodities. The analyst will apply knowledge of supply- side (Hydro, Nuclear, Fossil, Renewables, etc.) and demand-side technologies (energy efficiency, retail rates, population growth, distributed energy resources(DER), Batteries, electric vehicles, demand-response, calendar effects, etc.). The successful individual will have demonstrated skills and experience in the following areas: understanding of granular "big energy data" (i.e., LMPs, power plant generation, weather,Ancillary Services prices), data management techniques (gathering, assembling, formatting and maintaining valid data) applied to visualization, model building, and analysis. Furthermore, he or she will document visualization results, analytic procedures,methodologies and model frameworks; she or he will collaborate with others to prepare and deliver analytical findings succinctly to technical and non-technical audiences. The successful individual will be a team-player with strong model building experience rooted indata and theory.
