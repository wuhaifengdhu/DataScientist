        Automated Insights is the world leader in Natural Language Generation technology. In 2016, our Wordsmith platform turned raw data into 1.5 billion pieces of content - and we're just getting started. Crucial to Wordsmith's success is our Labs team: a group of independent thinkers and relentless creators working to build the next generation of natural language and automated data analysis technology.
        The Labs team is looking for a data scientist with a knack for turning long-term product goals into concrete results with a combination of creative and technical problem-solving skills.
        What you'll do:
        * Conceptualize and prototype new tools that help our customers and your coworkers do their jobs better.
        * Collaborate with developers and other stakeholders to get your ideas working in production.
        * Work with other Labs team members and company leadership to define long-term product end-states.
        * Set short-term goals that bring those end-states closer to reality.
        * Be a member of the larger data science community by sharing your work at conferences and on our tech blog.
        We're looking for people who:
        * Have 2+ years of work experience in a technical role.
        * Know how to write production-quality code using the right tools for the job, whether that means the PyData stack, the tidyverse, or a time-tested compiled language.
        * Have experience using machine learning to solve real-world problems, but the wisdom to not see every problem as a nail in search of a hammer.
        * Are lifelong learners who are excited to tackle problems they haven't seen before.
        Bonus points if you have:
        * A background in academic or industrial research.
        * An MS or PhD in computer science, math, or a related, math-heavy discipline.
        * Familiarity with the state-of-the-art in natural language technology.
