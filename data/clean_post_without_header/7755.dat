           About the Position
          The analytics software engineer is responsible for building and maintaining our mission-critical analytics stack. The stack includes a Redshift data warehouse, an Airflow-based ETL pipeline, custom JS scripts, EmberJS-based Segment tracking code, SQL migrations, and more. In this capacity, you will get the opportunity to work with and learn from the Web App, DevOps, Back-End, and Product teams. This is a system the majority of the company relies on to make data-driven decisions on both the R&D and S&M sides.
