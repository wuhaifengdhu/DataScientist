        Senior Data Scientist
        The internet is experiencing a transformation – ad blindness and blocking are forcing media companies and advertisers to rethink the way they connect with consumers. This evolution is changing the way we consume content and how we interact with brands. Nativo is enabling this shift to advertising that is mindful of the user experience, and is focusing on user attention and engagement - not just clicks and traffic. Our technology is digital advertising 2.0, and we pride ourselves on being thought leaders in the space as well as technology leaders utilizing ad technology that is not available anywhere else.
        The Nativo platform is used everyday by thousands of publications across billions of pageviews, by some of the largest and most important media companies in the world, who power their native programs and engage consumers with content rather than interruptive ads. Our main focus is to make elegant software that is both powerful and enjoyable to use.
        The Data Scientist will be part of a team responsible for designing and improving of our big data & data-science infrastructure. The team is also responsible for providing various advanced optimization technology & targeting solutions for large-scale problems in other areas of our system. We process over a billion events daily and the amount of data we process is growing rapidly. We believe in being smart, innovative, pragmatic, polished, and efficient and are looking for people that fit those values. This role reports to our Director of Data Science in Engineering.
