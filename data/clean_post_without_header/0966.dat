        Senior Software Engineer, Data Science
        At AppNexus, our data is our life line - we can only be as good as our data, and great data is critical for business success. Our data pipeline processes tens of billions of log records a day (more than 150TB of data) generated by our real-time bidding engines and ad serving platform. Data volume has rocketed over the past year and is continuing to increase – we have petabytes of data on store at this very moment. This data is used to generate aggregated analytics reports, budget spend accurately, and drive optimization engines.
        About the team:
        Our engineering team builds technology that identifies and analyzes relevant data to match buyers and sellers such that they each achieve their business initiatives. To do this, engineers partner with our Data Science team - implementing, testing and deploying complex machine learning models and intuitive, high-performance, real-time solutions for our diverse client base.
        Consider some of the problems you will try to solve:
        * Conversion attribution: In online advertising, we have to figure out which ad impression caused a user to make a purchase. We hunt for the needle in a 150 billion-row "haystack," and we do this millions of times every hour. We then use this to infer why the conversion happened and how we can change our real-time buying strategy to achieve more of these.
        * Processing data quickly and reliably: Our team is processing more and more data, pushing our decision engines to run with as little latency as possible. We get a kick out of making things that once took hours, only take minutes.
        * Real-time allocation: How much should an advertiser test new sites versus focus spend on the sites that are already known to be performant? How do advertisers allocate spend to the parts of the day that are most likely to result in user action? Our algorithms makes millions of micro adjustments in real-time to optimize our advertisers' allocation over the internet.
        * Scale: We are always seeking new and better ideas to help us meet our challenges. Our engineers get to build Internet-scale solutions to solve interesting math problems.
        About the job:
        * Design and develop large scale, high-performance software that interfaces multiple components of the AppNexus stack in order to identify and analyze new quantitative solutions in an effort to optimize our clients' day-to-day businesses
        * Collaborate with Data Scientists to create and implement complex mathematical models and machine learning algorithms
        * Work closely with other engineering teams to realize and implement the next evolution of our analytics driven software – building real-time decision making engines into the core business-generating aspects of the platform
        * Design/Implement/test and deploy code to production
        * Maintain and improve our code quality and stability
        * Implement technology frameworks
        * Act as a technical lead for projects as needed
        About your skills:
        * BA/BS degree and 3+ years of experience OR MS degree and 1+ years of experience in software engineering (Degree in Computer Science or related field preferred)
        * Object oriented programming experience in Java, Python, or C++
        * Experience with SQL (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (Redis, Aerospike)
        * Solid understanding of statistics and probability
        Nice to have:
        * Experience with Map/Reduce, batch processing such as Hadoop
        * Experience with Stream based passed processing models or control theory
        * Experience developing and implementing machine learning algorithms at scale
        More about you:
        * You are passionate about a culture of learning and teaching. You love challenging yourself to constantly improve, and sharing your knowledge to empower others
        * You like to take risks when looking for novel solutions to complex problems. If faced with roadblocks, you continue to reach higher to make greatness happen
        * You care about solving big, systemic problems. You look beyond the surface to understand root causes so that you can build long-term solutions for the whole ecosystem
        * You believe in not only serving customers, but also empowering them by providing knowledge and tool
        Learn. Teach. Build.
