        Zymergen is looking for a Director of Data Science to help take our data engineering, machine learning, and analytics to the next level. The ideal candidate will combine experience leading data teams in a commercial, data-driven organization, extensive background in applied machine learning, and genetics, computational biology, bioinformatics, or related discipline.
        Zymergen is a mature startup employing over 250 people, founded on the idea of applying modern software engineering, automation, cutting-edge genomics, large-scale data collection, machine learning, and statistical analysis techniques to genetic engineering and strain optimization. We are well-funded and proven in the real world.
        The Data Science team at Zymergen is responsible for a variety of critical functions:
        * We work with industrial engineers to analyze environment and process telemetry data to find opportunities to reduce errors and variability in DNA & microbe build and test processes.
        * We work with test and fermentation scientists to fine-tune experiment design, invent automated quality control mechanisms, create models of strain performance at industrial scale, and identify the best performing strains with a high degree of precision.
        * We work with experts in genetic engineering and strain design to create ML models and other data-driven tools to rank thousands of potential strain designs, and even to automatically propose novel strain designs.
        We derive immense satisfaction from seeing our work translated to the real-world: process inefficiencies get identified and addressed, strain build quality increases, and hypothesized genomes get created and tested in vitro. Ultimately, organisms designed with our help go on to create hundreds of thousands of tons of useful products used across the world. Process improvements discovered by Zymergen offset production of thousands of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere.
        The Data Science team is building a data ingestion, processing, analysis, and learning platform that will serve as the foundation for the company's data-driven future. We are finding algorithmic solutions to problems on the cutting edge of engineered biology. The work we do has the potential to fundamentally change how strains are designed and optimized for creating a wide variety of products, with broad applications across industries such as chemicals and materials, agriculture, and healthcare. Your leadership and insight will be key to ensuring we continue to deliver on this ambitious vision.
        As our first Director of Data Science you will have broad impact across the company, helping guide the roadmap and execution plan for a number of initiatives pertaining to applications of statistics, machine learning, data engineering, and more. You will act as a mentor and teacher to a diverse team working out of our Bay Area and Seattle offices. You will work with a talented team to develop a data-driven approach to solving major challenges in genetic engineering and evaluation and design of novel organisms. You will be a steward and an advocate of a creative, collaborative, and supportive culture within the Data Science team and across other departments.
        You will also be an ambassador of Zymergen in general and Data Science in particular: recruiting critical talent, telling our story at conferences and meetups, and sharing a culture of data engineering and analysis excellence that others want to join.
        Specific responsibilities
        * Help shape the vision for Data Science at Zymergen. Collaborate with the VP of Software Engineering and VP of Product Management in leading the creation of a technical roadmap for data science, and performing research into tools, techniques, and integratable technology and services that advance our analysis needs.
        * Foster a culture of fast iteration and experimentation, balanced by a long-term vision and the willingness to invest appropriate time and resources into stabilizing and polishing winning tools and solutions.
        * Mentor others. Empower data scientists, analysts, and engineers at every level to reach their full potential, and advance their mastery of the craft through design discussions, code reviews, and continuous feedback. Help individuals understand the context and long-term implications of their work and assist them in finding ways to make incremental progress towards major long-term goals.
        * Grow the team through recruiting, interviewing, and community outreach. Set up appropriate systems and processes to enable further growth and an increasingly broad impact of the data science team.
        * Prioritize work, hold the team accountable to deadlines, set and track appropriate metrics, and actively communicate about delays or roadblocks. Identify rabbit holes and bike sheds, and help the team avoid them as much as possible.
        * Facilitate communication about data issues throughout the organization. Champion initiatives related to data collection and standardization. Mediate discussions and help drive consensus around technical direction and decisions.
        Qualifications/Experience
        We favor candidates with the following credentials:
        * Ph.D., or industry experience equivalent in depth and rigour, in Computer Science, Computational Biology, Statistics, or related fields.
        * Extensive experience with machine learning.
        * 6+ years relevant work experience, including 3+ years of management experience.
        * If not a CS degree, extensive experience creating professional software.
        * Strong organizational skills, demonstrated ability to effectively prioritize, and a history of displaying initiative and dedication.
        * A track record of shipping solutions that leverage data to solve complex problems. You should have led teams that shipped non-trivial software and tools used by other people.
        * Strong technical leadership; ability to discuss and understand technical problems and provide mentorship in a modern software environment; understanding of software engineering best practices and tools.
        * Strong analytical skills. Demonstrated expertise in problem-solving and technical innovation.
        * Excellent written and oral communication skills.
        * Prior experience leading distributed or multi-site teams a plus.
        Our facility is located in the San Francisco bay area; Seattle-based candidates will also be considered.
