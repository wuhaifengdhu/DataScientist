        Sr. Manager, Predictive Analytics
        At Honeywell, our people are driven by a desire to contribute, be challenged and grow. Our people make Honeywell a special company and are a key competitive advantage.
        Honeywell Aerospace has approximately 40,000 employees around the world and 2015 revenue of $15 billion. Thousands of Honeywell Aerospace technologies, products and services are found on virtually every commercial, defense and space aircraft worldwide. We develop solutions that span air traffic modernization, flight and runway safety, engines, cockpit and cabin electronics, wireless connectivity, logistics and more. Honeywell Aerospace delivers safe, efficient, productive and more comfortable transportation experiences for manufacturers, airlines, business and general aviation aircraft, military and airports through three divisions, Air Transport and Regional, Business and General Aviation and Defense and Space
        Honeywell Aerospace products, services and digital environments collect millions of events per day and as a data driven company believe our data has great stories to tell us. As such, we are investing heavily in our data science capabilities and establishing a Data Science & Analytics team, chartered to build our predictive analytics capabilities for condition monitoring, predictive aircraft maintenance, optimize product performance & build recommendation systems for end customers. The system will ingest machine data from various aircraft systems, maintenance and other operations data including unstructured data, use machine learning and advanced analytics techniques to identify and predict failure patterns and provide recommendations to end customers to avoid unplanned maintenance.
        As the Senior Manager of Predictive Analytics, you would be responsible for guiding team of data scientists in building next generation aircraft condition monitoring & failure prediction systems. You will drive collaboration with aircraft systems subject matter experts to understand the domain, capture knowledge and guide the team in building advanced analytics models to identify & predict failure patterns. A key responsibility for this role would be managing delivery of analytics capabilities with external analytics partners. Additionally, you will provide direction in toolset selection, data source selection, and defining architecture of the overall system. You will also be responsible for mentoring and training a team of data engineers and data scientists on failure prediction techniques. You will work with mix of open source and in-house developed tools but looking for you to help us define the best-of-breed tool set.
