        Cloudera is looking for a Data Scientist to join our Data Science team. Our customers, around the world and across industries, have some of the biggest and most interesting data problems to solve. Cloudera helps customers store and manage their data with open source software, and our team's mission is to teach them to uncover the surprising and valuable insights in data. Are you the type of data scientist who enjoys talking shop at length? digging into practical problems with messy real-world data? building open source tools that improve the experience of data scientists building models on huge amounts of data?
        Our Team.
        The Data Science team at Cloudera is a small, expert team based in the US and UK. We provide our expertise in methods and tools (like R, Python, and Apache Spark) internally and to our customers. We're engineers and statisticians, the practical types, who regularly build and contribute to open source tools. We also collaborate with our architects and customers' analysts to prototype new analytics projects and "teach the organization to fish". All of us talk about data science a lot, and regularly evangelize the practice of data science through writing and speaking. We provide strategy and advice for Cloudera and our customers.
        Being a Data Scientist at Cloudera
        As a Cloudera Data Scientist, you would spend about half time with our customers, helping them to solve their analytics problems in short projects in conjunction with our architects. Depending on your areas of expertise you'd be called on to sometimes just provide advice on a problem. Occasionally, this entails some travel.
        Otherwise, in collaboration with the rest of the team, you'll become an expert in open source tools for analytics in the Hadoop ecosystem. You'll help us create blog posts and white papers, and deliver talks about important issues and techniques in data science as well.
        And You Are ...
        Data science is a broad and quickly changing field. You will be a good fit for our team if you are up for both learning new tools and techniques and sharing your knowledge with others. A data scientist who will be successful on our team will enjoy, more than anything, teaching the world about data science. An ideal candidate will be comfortable acting independently, enjoy talking to customers about their challenges, and rapidly building prototypes.
        A data scientists who will be successful in this job is likely to have 5+ years of industry experience, and a BS / MS (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics or a similar field. A working knowledge of Linux and a strong working knowledge of linear algebra, statistics and essential machine learning techniques will be important. Working knowledge of Apache Hadoop components (Spark, HDFS, YARN, etc.) is not required but will be helpful.
        For us, specialized expertise in an analytics technique like deep learning, NLP, or anomaly detection, would be a plus, as is expertise in an industry (healthcare, telecom, e-tailing, etc.)
