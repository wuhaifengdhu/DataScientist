            Work with our CTO, VP of Engineering and Architect to communicate the technical roadmap and vision and strategic value for these initiatives.
            Engage with development leaders to articulate requirements, project plans and drive timely execution towards launch.
            Bridge the gap between our technical needs and the requirements of our users including providing detailed product requirements for implementation of changes to our systems.
            Focus on scalability needs and ensuring our systems can handle our volumes in a timely manner.
            Deliver products with our technical teams, always keeping in mind the complexities of highly scalable engineering endeavors.
            Define, track, and improve key product metrics to implement a product dashboard to track usage and success.
            Our ideal candidate will have…
            Bachelor’s degree or higher (Masters preferred) – preferably in relevant technical fields such as Computer Science, Analytics, etc.

            Expertise communicating progress at each phase of development as appropriate, including published roadmaps, requirements and other information
            Knowledge of marketing technology (this can be overcome by a quick learner with a sharp intellect!)
            High degree of both technical expertise and business acumen, including familiarity developing new software and implications of SaaS business models
            Strong results-orientation combined with excellent judgment and problem-solving skills; track record of product success
