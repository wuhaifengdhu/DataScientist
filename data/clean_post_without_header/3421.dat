             Real Problems, Real Data!
           Imagine being part of an integrated team of researchers applying the power of extreme computing, data analytics and revolutionary sensor technologies to enable a new era of computational predictive biology.
           Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) is engaged in efforts to develop and advance capability in computational predictive biology. A wide range of partners in this National initiative share a common vision and are working collaboratively to enable a revolutionary approach to improve cancer science, detect and mitigate biological threats and improve biological understanding through the integration of sensors and experiments, cutting-edge computational simulations, large-scale statistical analysis tools, and bioscience based theory and algorithm development.
           We currently have an opening for a Data Scientist. You will be part of a team which develops a unified computational and data space that more tightly weaves together biological sensors and experiments, cutting-edge computational simulations, large-scale statistical analysis tools, and bioscience-based theory and algorithm development.
           This position will be filled at either the SES.4 or SES.5 level, depending on your qualifications. Additional job responsibilities (outlined below) will be assigned if you are selected at the higher level.
