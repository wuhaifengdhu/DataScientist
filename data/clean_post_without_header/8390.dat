        Our Company:
        Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE: COF) is a new breed of financial services provider and Fortune 500 company (#127). With more than 65 million customer accounts, our company has grown explosively since our IPO in 1994 and emerged with the two things most growing companies can only dream to achieve: one of the Americas' largest consumer franchises with one of the most recognized brands (and wallet taglines!) in the United States. We're an acknowledged leader in innovation by Tech Crunch for our "surprisingly well designed" Apple Pay introduction and also in work-life balance and inclusion as one of Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For.
        Capital One, which is still led by our founding CEO, Richard Fairbank, has grown into a $40B+ public corporation, known for world-class analytics and strategy, fueled by a brave internal culture. We were born as the first company to develop and offer mass customization and personalization of credit card products, and we've been adding businesses and innovating relentlessly ever since. Here you'll find hackers, rockers, artists, entrepreneurs, and data scientists. As a team, we come to work every day looking to build digital experiences that are authentic & bold. Today we are a high-tech company, a scientific laboratory, and a well-funded force focused on designing a better way for people to engage with their money, their bank, and their financial lives. It's audacious work at a massive scale and, hey, we think it's pretty rewarding.
