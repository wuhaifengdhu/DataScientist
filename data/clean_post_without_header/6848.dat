Data Management within IKU is the proactive alignment of Celgene's data science needs, data governance standards and our growing network of strategic data partners. As the complexity and sources of healthcare data rapidly evolves, Data Management ensures that IKU's systems and capabilities evolve with it; allowing us to meet our changing data science needs and fuel the development of innovative medicines for patients.
