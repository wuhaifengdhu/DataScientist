        Job Description
        Arconic Wheel and Transportation Products invented the first forged aluminum truck wheel in 1948â€”and by doing so, we created an entire industry. Seven decades later, we're proud to be the global market leader in the forged, aluminum heavy-duty truck wheel market, holding the number one position. We've helped customers around the world to increase payload while saving fuel and reducing maintenance by switching out heavy steel wheels for lightweight aluminum.
        The Data Scientist is responsible for analyzing AWTP data across processes to "tell a story" and make recommendations. The Data Scientist also investigates relationships among variables across a variety of functional disciplines but primarily manufacturing operations (e.g. performance metrics, cost components, quality data, design parameters, machine parameters, process characteristics, etc.).
        Job Responsibilities and Duties:
        * Organize, create and analyze large-scale historian and SQL data sets;
        * Provide ideas and influence a growing data driven culture and gain operational experience with Big Data;
