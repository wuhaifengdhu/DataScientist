           Sr. Associate Product Manager
           Money is the central enabler for daily life – so why has the way we interact with our money remained relatively static?
           While other industries have undergone major transformation, dramatic change in the financial services industry is decades overdue. Capital One is on a journey to bring ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity back to banking. Money is never just digits on a screen to us – it’s someone’s groceries, first car, new home, or plane tickets home for the holidays. We measure our success by our customer’s success.
           Our quest to change the industry shows up across our business, and we’re making real time improvements that positively shape our customer’s financial health. As a company, it’s not enough to just look at what we can do now, but also, what we can do in the future. Entrepreneurship and innovation are deeply ingrained in the DNA of our company – stemming from our founder, CEO, and Chairman of the Board – Richard Fairbanks . We have a startup culture with the financial backing of a Fortune 200 company. Our team in Plano, TX is a cross-functional team of product managers, designers, data scientists, and full stack developers committed to transforming the Auto Finance and Home Loans industry.
