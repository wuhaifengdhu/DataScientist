        CDK Global works in a broad variety of technologies, so your Java, .Net, C#, C++, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 or any one of a broad range of technologies and skills may work well with us. We work on software that is used by consumers to shop for cars (or trucks or boats or motorcycles or tractors or more), as well as the systems used by about two-thirds of the dealers in the US to take care of their customers and their interface with the manufacturers. If you recently ordered a Ferrari, or a Ford, you likely have used our products!

Our Agile, collaborative approach is important to everyone here.
