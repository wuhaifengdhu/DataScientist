        Editorial Fellow — Los Angeles, BFEG
        The BuzzFeed Fellowship is a three-month program for the next generation of writers, editors, and content creators eager to master the tools and techniques of social storytelling across multiple social platforms. Over the course of the program, you will learn how to create the type of content that readers love to share. You must have a deep understanding and passion for the digital and pop cultural landscape with intimate knowledge of the latest and greatest in social media, content, and emerging technology/platforms.
        We're looking for hungry culture maniacs obsessed with the things people are sharing, liking, recommending and talking about. You should also have:
        * High emotional intelligence
        * A positive, curious, playful disposition (no haters)
        * A competitive drive — you enjoy winning, really going for it
        * A genuine, wide-eyed love of pop culture in all its forms
        * An interest in social platforms and what drives people to share content on the web
        * Curiosity and excitement about social platforms (Snapchat, Instagram, Tumblr, etc.)
        In addition, you should demonstrate the following:
        * 1-3 years of experience with writing content for the web
        * Experience with Photoshop is a plus
        * Ability to conceive of ideas, jump on social trends, and produce posts for the website
        * Ability to handle critical feedback and improve from it
        * Eagerness to work in a highly collaborative environment
        Fellows will work with and learn from members of the BuzzFeed team. This is the perfect opportunity for someone interested in pursuing a career in writing. We look for people who are fascinated by the web, human psychology and pop culture. This is a paid position based in our Los Angeles office.
        To apply:
        * No formal cover letters, please. But do include a few short paragraphs about what topics you'd want to write about on BuzzFeed, and what about the site interests you.
        * Create a BuzzFeed.com/community profile, and create 2-3 posts that reflect your voice and interests. DON'T FORGET TO SEND LINKS!
        * Provide links to your public social media accounts.
        * Attach a resume.
