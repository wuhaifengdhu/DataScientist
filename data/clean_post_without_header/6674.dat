                Prepare human blood samples for IVD testing
                Create test tubes with known concentrations of doping agents in human blood.
                Blood and doping agents arrive in large volume containers.
                Each test tube shall be prepared with a pre-determined level of one or more doping agent as per a test plan.
                The doping agent concentration shall be confirmed by running the test tubes on an existing, validated IVD instrument.
                Prepare ~200 test tubes per week. Create variants of each test tube (ex. applying additional barcode labels, capping / decapping the tube, etc.).
                Prepare ~1,000 variants per week.
                Process prepared human blood samples on IVD device under development
                Load the prepared blood samples onto various prototypes of the IVD device under development.
                Run prototype data collection SW with simple GUI designed for someone with a technician level of training / education.
                Unload samples and store / dispose of used tubes according to standard laboratory bio-hazard practices.
                Provide feedback to HW / SW development teams on any unusual system behavior / issues encountered during data collection.
                Collate collected data and prepare it for data scientists by following simple pre-developed instructions / tools.
                Training shall be provided for all equipment / procedures / tools / etc.
