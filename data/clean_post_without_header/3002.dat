·       Mine large amounts of data for insights with both automated and ad-hoc queries
·       Communicate complex findings and ideas in plain language that is friendly to business and operational audiences
·       Problem solve – turn requirements into solutions
·       Collaborate with team members with varying technical and non-technical backgrounds towards a shared goal
·       Rapidly research and iterate on analysis methods by finding elegant, reliable and understandable techniques to build analytics that matter
·       Create technical assessments and develop custom approaches in response to time-critical urgent customer needs
·       Employ sophisticated analytics programs, machine learning, and statistical methods to prepare data for use in predictive and prescriptive             modeling
·       Examine new and more convincing methods for data reporting, visualization & presentation
·       Develop new approaches to apply large-scale computing technology to solve customer problems
·       Be involved in all stages of analytic development from idea formation through prototyping, automation, and productizing
·       Maintain up-to-date knowledge of technology standards, industry trends, emerging techniques, and analytic best practices
·       Keep informed of evolution and impact of adversary tactics and strategies
·       Ensure analytical issues are quickly resolved and help implement strategies and solutions to reduce the likelihood of reoccurrence
