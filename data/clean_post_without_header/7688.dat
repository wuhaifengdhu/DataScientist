             The client understands the objectives of the FBI's Facilities Logistics and Services Division and Finance Division (FLSD/FD) to establish processes, architecture, technology and talent to employ the current enterprise data warehouse environment, Financial Information Repository Environment (FIRE) as a basis of information management and provider for analytical services to the enterprise.

             The government is seeking to leverage the current FIRE environment and tools to support analytics. This includes enhancing and expanding the FIRE data processing, data dissemination, and data delivery capabilities based on findings from data analytic efforts. As reflected in the design document, FIRE is a complex system with many components dependent on one another. This is particularly true for the extract/transform/load (ETL) processes. Data from disparate data sources must move through a number of ETL zones (e.g., landing, staging zone, data warehouse (DW), reporting) before it can be used effectively. Performing analytics may require modifications/enhancements including the creation of new data structures, new ETL processes and new data dissemination solutions. The addition of new components could affect existing components and must be addressed carefully.
               Advanced Analytic Capabilities:
             Analytical capabilities in the analytics platform enable data scientists and business analysts to create advanced analytical models, access data, and present the findings to line of business and executive users through interactive dashboards, reports and scorecards. Greater efficiency and effectiveness of the analytics platform and data management comes from defining and establishing processes for addressing inter-related disciplines across people, process, and technology with a holistic, aligned and comprehensive approach.
             Our analytics environment will bring the right tools and technology such as SPSS Modeler, R, ETL, Web Focus, and other government approved tools for assisting data analytics capabilities, establishing and maintaining the data analytics processes, environments and services.
