        Weekend Social Media Strategist
        BuzzFeed Motion Pictures is seeking a brilliant, funny, and dedicated weekend social media strategist to take our weekend social media game to the next level. We're looking for a social strategist to grow our accounts, jump in on trending news and adapt schedule depending on breaking stories, and work with our data team to identify and communicate the results of our projects, and adapt BuzzFeed Entertainment Group (BFEG) content to mobile-first social platforms. The perfect candidate will have professional experience in social media, excellent communication skills, and proven success in growing accounts with an innovative, playful approach.
        This position will use data to inform decisions, and will collaborate closely with the curation team, the operations team, and video producers to ensure that our content is being released in the most optimal way across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and more.
        Because the position will be working on the weekends, the ideal candidate will be a multitasking rockstar who can juggle several different priorities at once, while working very autonomously. The ideal candidate is organized, detail-oriented, and enthusiastic about social media and all things BuzzFeed. We're looking for a data-obsessed self-starter with excellent judgement and communication skills.
