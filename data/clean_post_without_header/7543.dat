Model performance will be evaluated against real customer data.  The candidate is expected to understand how to test, evaluate and present the performance of their models to the lab, peers, business units and customers. Technology development in the lab ranges from advanced statistics (e.g., regression models) to machine learning. As technology development progresses and business value is evaluated the successful candidate will work closely with the product team lead to integrate and merge the technology into the product.  This relationship starts early and becomes progressively more collaborative as value and success are realized.
