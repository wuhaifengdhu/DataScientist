         The Oracle Data Cloud is on the cutting edge in development of targeting methodologies for digital and offline advertising. The biggest advertisers and social media platforms in the world use these methods to help better understand and plan their advertising strategies.
         We are looking for a computer scientist who is willing to focus on the architecture and software design load on a Data Science team.  Previous data science experience is not expected, but a willingness to learn would provide success! As a Senior Data Scientist (Data Scientist III) on the audience research team you’ll be implementing the engineering architecture underling cutting edge machine learning and high performance computing methodologies at terabyte and beyond scale. This includes collaborating with data scientists and applying robust software architectural decision-making skills to optimize performance and accuracy of first-in-industry techniques to target media campaigns.
         Primary responsibilities include:
         * Providing thought leadership in the implementation of engineering solutions
         * Communicating with data scientists and statisticians
         * Researching and implementing the newest big data technologies to create solutions at scale
         * Identifying opportunities for improvement within existing software applications and frameworks
         * Acting as a source of knowledge and mentorship for non-engineering background data scientists
         * Being agile in a non-agile software development environment: setting your own deadlines and providing project status updates when necessary
         Here’s a summary of the various skills that could provide success in this position:
         *  2+ years experience in software development with a computer science bachelors degree or 1+ years experience with an advanced degree

         * Fluency with one or more high level programming languages (Python, Scala, Julia)
         * Experience with C or Java
         * Some computer science niche ability: Javascript/D3 web-stack hacker, low level GPU programmer, expert in parallel programming, puppet/packer/docker pro, etc.
         * Deep understanding of computer science: Data structures and algorithmic complexity theory are the first things you think of when designing an algorithm
         * Ability to hack a solution together quickly and improve it later
         * Experience with standard software development practices including object oriented programming, functional programming, test based design
         * Linux pro with no fear of administering your own machines
         * Fan of not inventing the wheel by utilizing and improving open source solutions to complex problems
         * Exceptional problem solving skills with unrelenting focus on business implications
