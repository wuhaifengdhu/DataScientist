        The Intelligence and Decision Technologies Group develops advanced software techniques for processing, exploitation, and dissemination of data from many types of sensors, including radar, electro-optic, video, and radio frequency, as well as from people and the Internet. The goal is to develop and prototype analytics and architectures that support decision makers. This work begins with an understanding of the workflows of intelligence analysts and military commanders, often through operations research. Operational data sets are amassed to support all types of algorithm development, such as multi-sensor fusion, data mining, graph-based network detection, and entity tracking. An agile development methodology then creates prototype systems for data exploitation and knowledge management which are then delivered to our user community for feedback and iterative refinement. The challenges of heterogeneous sensor systems and overwhelmingly large data volumes drive experimentation with architectures for network-centric exploitation and distributed storage and computation. Areas of technical staff expertise in the group include machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, graph analytics, distributed software systems analysis and development, modeling and simulation, software development, and field experimentation.
        A research position is currently available to develop automated intelligence systems for large multi-sensor and open source data sets. Projects involve system design and architecture and the development of algorithms for machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and graph analytics implemented on enterprise big data architectures. Data Scientists and/or Software Engineers/Architects are encouraged to apply.
