It is helping to shift our model toward asset-based consulting and is a foundation for – and expands our investment in – our entrepreneurial culture. Through innovative software as a service solutions, strategic acquisitions, and a vibrant ecosystem of alliances, we are redefining what it means to work with McKinsey.
        McKinsey Solutions is a core part of New Ventures and offers practical tools that help people at all levels of an organization generate insights they need to address both strategic and day-to-day decisions. These solutions complement McKinsey's traditional client service and are delivered in many ways, including subscriptions, workshops, training programs and project-based engagements. We work closely with clients to embed our tools, analytics and expertise, and provide on-going support to help them build the capabilities they need to revolutionize how decisions are made.
        What You'll Do
        You will push our solutions further by identifying new ways to leverage our data, helping us to develop new capabilities, and managing data sharing with select partners.

        Additionally, you'll answer pressing questions by developing and testing hypotheses based on our data, and working closely with SMEs to identify, refine, and deliver relevant analyses. You'll meet client needs by performing additional analysis to support and respond to client asks, and preparing client-ready output for delivery and participate in client meetings. Furthermore, you'll have the opportunity to provide thought leadership on Analytics to subject matter experts and product managers, who will rely on your input for how to structure questions, refine data collection, determine the most interesting analyses, and deliver effective insights.
        You'll stay on the cutting edge of your field by keeping current with the latest analytical tools, data sources, and trends, and incorporating the most effective ones into our work. Your work will be interdisciplinary - you'll have the chance to work across a variety of topics, demonstrating an ability to apply your analytical capabilities to developing insights in new areas where you may not at first have expertise.
