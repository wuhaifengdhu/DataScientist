        About the Job
        Jet is looking for an expert in large-scale experiment design to help lead the technical direction and analysis for our Testing and Site Optimization practice. Jet.com is one of the fastest growing companies in history providing the goods that power millions of households in the US and growing to a $1B run rate in a matter of months since launch. We want to continue creating amazing experiences for our users and partners, and improve site speed and performance in all areas. In order to hit these objectives, one of our key initiatives is to further build out internal tools with a vision of creating industry-leading tools for running hundreds of simultaneous, overlapping experiments. This role will be in the Customer Analytics group and report to the VP of Analytics.
        How you can impact the company:
        You will have two primary objectives:
        * Driving the core requirements for the design of a world-class experiment deployment, management, and measurement tool. This tool will be used across the company and will be a key piece in our ability to succeed as we scale.
        * Be the go-to person for intelligent, rigorous experiment design, and be a leader in experiment analysis for the most important and complex experiments. These analyses will be key in decisions that will have major impact on the user experience and strategic choices.
        In short: you will have real opportunity to have a significant impact on the organization.
        What you can learn:
        It's not a one-way street. In addition to great compensation and benefits plans, we want you to continue growing as a professional:
        * You will work closely with incredibly talented people across the company, from a huge variety of backgrounds, (from Technologists to Scientists to Financiers to Retail GM's to CPG Marketers to Consultants and on and on), and learn from their collective experience and through working with them.
        * You will be challenged by the nature of what needs to occur and the scale involved. Success on this program will give you a great opportunity to be a leader in the space.
        * You will be a part of a team that just was a part of the largest eCom transaction in history as we figure out how to leverage the power of the largest most successful retail company in the world, Walmart.
        * You will have incredible exposure to all aspects of Retail/eCom from the technical, strategic, and operational perspective.
        * You will have access to training and classes in a variety of areas from your peers and from training professionals.
        * You will get to see first-hand how a scaling tech organization organizes its Product and Tech functions and how that manifests organizationally and operationally.
        About You
        * You have a PhD (or were a truly spectacular Masters student with exceptional business experience) in an area related to: Statistics, Applied Math, Economics, or one of the Sciences.
        * You almost certainly have experience working on this topic at another organization and when you read "we create orthogonal universes of user randomization to enable the execution of numerous overlapping tests" you know why this is the case, the limitations to the statement, and understand how it could be achieved.
        * You have dealt with large scale experiments that have numerous confounding, exogenous, and unobserved factors but know how to get to a real result anyway.
        * You want to work in a place that has a tech startup environment and know that this means being a self-starter who can help drive a project forward in a shifting environment.
        * You like working on teams with other smart people and sometimes going off on your own and just getting things done in a positive and intellectually challenging environment.
        * You have a high level of comfort with analytical approaches and quantitative methods. It doesn't really matter which tools you prefer; what is important is that you have the skills to deal very large datasets on whichever tools makes sense.
        * Ability to distill signal from noise, and to communicate and visualize findings with non-technical stakeholders.
        * You have a flexible, collaborative approach to problem solving, in which creative and quick thinking can lead to a solution in hours rather than days.
