        ZEFR is growing! We are hiring a new Senior Data Scientist to be involved in building and optimizing large-scale systems to acquire, process, store, and understand multiple terabytes of YouTube and other social media data. This role is an important part of the rapidly growing demands of being the leader in VideoID technology for content owners and brands. In this role you will use engineering principles to bring machine learning models based on our data to production quickly.
        What you get to do:
        * Participate as a member of the Data Science team, work closely with fellow data scientists, product managers and engineers
        * Design, implement, test, and monitor both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models
        * Make use of NLP and image processing algorithms to help better understand our data
        * Prototype creative solutions quickly, test theories, evaluate feature concepts and iterate rapidly
        Your background likely includes:
        * MS/PhD in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Electrical Engineering with strength in Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and Image Processing
        * Ability to think critically about the relationships of different metrics measured and process steps to land the right features for a given model
        * Must have experience developing end-to-end machine learning pipeline from data exploration, feature engineering, model building, performance evaluation, and online testing with large data sets
        * Experience with Knowledge Management for Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval applications and services: search, clustering, classification
        * Experience with large-scale data analysis frameworks: Hadoop, Spark, SQL
        * 3+ years of experience with at least one dynamically typed language, one statically typed language, and experience at the Unix shell. Here at ZEFR we use Python and Scala.
        * Cloud computing infrastructure on Amazon is a plus
        * Strong foundation in data structures, algorithms and software design
        * Openness to new technologies and creative solutions
