        The Mission of Oracle Labs is straightforward: Identify, explore, and transfer new technologies that have the potential to substantially improve Oracle's business. The Information Retrieval and Machine Learning group (IRML) in Oracle Labs is working to develop, scale and deploy Machine Learning throughout all of Oracle's Products and Services.
        As our group grows and tackles new problems, we have more and more need for custom research and data wrangling platforms. We are looking for engineers with experience developing tools in the big data space to join our team in Burlington, Massachusetts. She or he will enjoy defining and developing creative solutions to meet the varying needs of researchers and data scientists as they work with and develop prototypes for product groups inside the company. This position may touch on tools for all aspects of large data systems, ranging from storage to analytics to artifact tracking and data science notebooks. As an example, one of the systems the group currently maintains is a distributed data store, called AURA, that scales to billions of objects, can run custom code right next to the data, and handles full-text queries in milliseconds. It has been used to support tasks such as candidate generation and random sampling.
        Candidates must have a BS or MS in Computer Science and at least 5 years of experience developing solid, maintainable, object-oriented code.
        Required Skills and Experience:
        * Define and develop creative solutions to meet the varying needs of researchers and data scientists as they work with and develop prototypes for product groups inside the company
        * Strong Java skills, or similar language with willingness to work in Java
        * Solid grasp of data structures and algorithms, finding the right tool for the job
        * Feels at home working in a Unix/Unix-like environment and with Unix tools
        * Working knowledge of full stack development from back end to interfaces
        * Desire to find the right solution to a problem, not just the most expedient one
        * Willingness to solve the hard problems so that your users don't have to
        * Excellent written and oral communication skills
        * Understanding of machine learning and data science workflows
        Preferred Skills and Experience:
        * Experience building scalable systems that run on distributed platforms
        * Familiarity with distributed computation frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, or MPI
        * Knowledge of Python and scikit-learn
