        We are looking for a hands-on, results-oriented, intellectually curious, self-learning Sr. Data Scientist to join our Marketing Analytics team. Our mission is to understand the behavior of our customers with respect to how they interact with our web properties, product UIs, subscriptions, marketing channels, CRM systems, and sales platforms so that we can provide the most actionable and impactful insights, advice, and data products to our Marketing organization. Although we expect you to have experience using a variety of modeling and algorithmic methods and familiarity with digital marketing practices, web analytics, and customer lifetime value, we also expect you to apply strong business acumen to the models you build. You possess excellent communication skills and are able to engage with senior leaders to design well-constructed analyses and work cross-functionally with analysts, product managers and engineers to effectively deliver actionable results.
        You will be joining a team environment like no other. You will not find big egos here. You will find a strong team of analysts that thrives equally on learning and teaching -- we value learning from the most junior to the most senior members of our team and beyond. We are passionate about our work, and our appetite for improving existing skills while acquiring new ones is insatiable. We practice and demand transparency – we work hard to spread, not hoard, our knowledge within our team and across the organization. We often refer to ourselves as Business Scientists because, ultimately, our job is to acquire knowledge about the business so we can apply scientific techniques to drive profitable growth. If you share our values, we would love to hear from you.
