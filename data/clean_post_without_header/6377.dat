        The Opportunity
        Vantiv's growth is one attributed not only to our first-in-class products and services, but also our ability to find new avenues of opportunity.

        The Data Scientist designs and develops methods and systems that have the ability to consolidate and analyze "big data" that generate insights to untapped client solutions. He/she will develop and code software programs, algorithms and automated processes to cleanse large datasets into meaningful information for gathering insight. By being able to draw conclusions from large, disparate sources of data, Vantiv can identify and pursue new areas of growth, preempt trends and continue our exponential growth.
        Rewarding Impact. Fulfilling Careers.
        Making an impact isn't something reserved for people in corner offices. At Vantiv, it comes from people in every corner of the office. People with ambition, optimism and courage. We provide growth and opportunity and give employees flexibility in how they get the job done. You might not expect that from a big payments company, but we're smart enough to know how to hire the best and when to step aside and let them lead. Our goal is that you never stop learning and you never cease to amaze--especially yourself. If this fits your career goal, we can't wait to welcome you on board.
