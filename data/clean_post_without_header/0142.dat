        The Healthcare Analytics team uses healthcare data (payer / provider / 3rd party data) and analytics to answer some of the most pressing questions our healthcare clients have today such as "How do we manage cost of care while improving quality?", "How do we remain competitive in the evolving healthcare landscape?", "Who are the most vulnerable patients and what interventions can we design to better care for them?".
        Our capabilities are foundational to multiple high profile initiatives and have been core to the Healthcare practice in delivering organization wide transformation programs for payors (public and private) or providers. The MHA team has grown to 160+ colleagues globally over the last 4 years. It is a unique mix of Healthcare Experts, physicians, statisticians, engineers, data scientists, and more.
        New Ventures is a recently formed part of McKinsey focused on fostering innovations driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile, social and other technologies and integrating them into our client work. It is a foundation for—and expands our investment in—our entrepreneurial culture.
        What You'll Do
        You'll be actively engaged with front-line client teams involved in helping hospitals implement operational improvements and organizational enhancements that boost cost effectiveness and improve quality of care for patients. You will bring your healthcare expertise, operational experience and analytical skills to bear on topics ranging from clinical operations to revenue cycle management to procurement and workforce management.
        You will leverage your expertise to take ownership of tenure-appropriate client relationships and guide clients through appropriate syndication discussions as well as longer-term front-line implementation projects.
