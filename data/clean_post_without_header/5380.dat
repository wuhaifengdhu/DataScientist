        Background:
        Our first and flagship product, TrashBot, is a "smart" trash can that combines next-generation robotics and sensor technology capable of differentiating recyclables from non-recyclable material. Simply place your garbage in a Trashbot and walk away. TrashBot automatically sorts recyclables such as metals, plastics, and glass from landfill waste, while simultaneously gathering information about the type of waste generated.
        A single TrashBot has the potential to replace all of the conventional, spaceconsuming trash and recycling bins we currently use. From corporate workplaces, to stadiums and ball parks, to universities, schools, and airports, the practical applications for TrashBot are endless.
        We're looking for an outstanding Software Engineer with a machine learning background who combines excellent technical skills and a demonstrated ability to get things done quickly and effectively. Applications from all skill levels and backgrounds are appreciated.
        Preferred Skills and Qualifications:
        * 3+ years of experience in a Software Engineering related field
