        We're looking for a passionate Product Manager who knows how to ask the right questions and work collaboratively in order to define the right problem, craft solutions, and deliver validated products to our clients. This includes facilitating discussions that could be as small as three members to as large as an executive conference room. The candidate will know when to dig deeper, and when to assume the risk and push to ship.
        Responsibilities:
        * Quickly understand a specific domain and identify the trends and opportunities in that space
        * Bridge the technical and business worlds as you help to design and ship product
        * Work closely with your team to help generate profitable revenue streams for our clients
        * Confidently run a room and draw out all the voices by facilitating the right activities to get the right information
        * Mentor, coach and collaborate with the client product team to drive decisions
        * Work with your team to discern what needs to be tested and how to test it
        * Conduct interviews (generative, usability, etc.) and synthesize insights into actionable next steps
        * Create a backlog, write stories, and manage releases
        * Communicate effectively across all team roles
        * Act as an ambassador for your team to all stakeholders so they can focus on building the right product
        Who would love this role:
        Someone who enjoys working in a highly collaborative environment. Our project teams can include PMs, designers, engineers, data scientists and other roles - and pairing across these specialties leads to incredible results.
        Someone who can't get enough of product and learning. Our clients come from nearly every vertical out there and you'll be able to work hand-in-hand with the decision makers in each.

In this role, you will work with the project team, client execs and the whole spectrum of PMs (project, product, program and any similar roles that a client may have) - to progress the goal of shipping the right product to the client's users.
        Someone who can go home at the end of the day. There are no product launch slog weeks in this role. Work / life balance isn't just something that we want you to have, but something we need you to teach to our clients.
