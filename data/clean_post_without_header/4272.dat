        Who You'll Work With
        You will work with our Navimeter team in Waltham, Massachusetts.
        Navimeter is a new tool that has been developed recently and is an innovative and disruptive proprietary solution - a software platform for port and container terminal clients that combines real-time satellite tracking of commercial vessels with predictive analytics to forecast vessel movements and arrival times in order to support planning of terminal operations. We are now at the point where we will be releasing the first version of the product to multiple clients over this summer, while continuously making improvements to the analytics engine.
        Navimeter is part of McKinsey Solutions and McKinsey's New Ventures - a recently formed part of McKinsey focused on fostering innovations driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile, social and other technologies and integrating them into our client work. It is a foundation for—and expands our investment in—our entrepreneurial culture.
        What You'll Do
        You will support the continuous improvement of the core predictive engine, as well as work with pilot clients to understand how the tool performs and what value it brings to clients.
        You'll leverage your expertise in predictive statistics/machine learning and your experience in implementing predictive models in R or Python, as well as top notch problem solving skills. You'll own the Solution methodology and IP, and act as a Specialist with clients or McKinsey teams, facilitating the implementation of the Solution. You'll participate in the definition of the product roadmap and manage the development of the product with the IT teams in charge of the technical product development.
        Additionally, you'll be involved in specific client projects involving the building of new, bespoke advanced analytical solutions for clients (in this role, you may be integrated into a broader McKinsey client project team).
