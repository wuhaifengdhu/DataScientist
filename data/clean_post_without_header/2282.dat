         Who We Are
            Transform an Industry. Transform Your Career.
            We’re constantly innovating the mortgage industry, so we’re constantly looking for flexible, curious minds that thrive when collaborating to solve complex problems.
            And once those problems are solved, they’re ready for whatever’s next.
            On the Technology team, when you’re not busy revolutionizing the mortgage industry with the technology that you create, you’ll get personal time each week to work on whatever tech projects you want.
            If you’re ready to transform an industry and transform your career, we want to hear from you.
         What You'll Do/Need

If data is the vehicle that unlocks new frontiers of business capability in the Information Age, Data Scientists are the drivers.  At Quicken Loans, we rely on Data Scientists to unleash the potential of machine learning, Big Data and modeling to solve critical business challenges that give us a competitive edge.
