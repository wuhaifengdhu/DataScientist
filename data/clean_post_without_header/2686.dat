            Does this describe you?
           A multi-tasking, organizing, jump-right-in kind of person. You thrive on a fast-paced, fluid environment that values teamwork, collaboration, hard work, and flawless execution. You want to have fun at work while delivering exceptional results, and you’re comfortable interacting with senior leaders. You’re looking for a role as an assistant that will provide tons of opportunity to learn a new company, new role, or new industry. You love technology and want to see how innovation is happening, up close and in person.
           At Capital One Labs, our assistants are the heartbeat of our team. Beyond the normal scheduling meetings, travel, and expense reports, they plan events, give tours, serve as a liasion between teammates & leaders, and keep our organization on track and running smoothly. They’re comfortable and confident resolving ambiguity, and help bring order to our dynamic, high energy team.
            About Capital One Labs
           Money is the central enabler for daily life – so why has the way we interact with our money remained relatively static?
           Capital One is on a journey to bring ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity back to banking. Money is never just digits on a screen to us – it’s someone’s groceries, first car, new home, or plane tickets home for the holidays. We measure our success by our customer’s success. In short, we’re on a quest to change banking for good.
           Founded in 2011, Capital One Labs is the company’s experimental product & technology incubator and accelerator. It’s a startup culture with the financial backing of a Fortune 200 company. With teams in SF, NYC, and DC, Labs is a cross-functional team of product managers, designers, data scientists, developers, and other innovators who are committed to:
            Inspire, explore, enable, and deliver.
            Redefine how people interact with their money.
           We do this by looking 2-3 years into the future to identify high impact opportunities, and then we set out to develop and deliver new and impactful solutions that help customers and Capital One succeed. To see what we’ve been up to, follow us on Twitter @capitalonelabs.
