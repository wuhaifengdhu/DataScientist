           Title:
            Senior Data Scientist – Test and Learn Analytics
           Reports to:   Director Analytics
           Location:      NY Office
           Overview:    J.Crew is seeking a Senior Data Scientist with an emphasis on Test and Learn Analytics to join our team of highly successful predictive analysts. If you have a passion for “wowing” business leaders with exceedingly progressive analytics techniques, working with managers who “get” the work you are doing and support your efforts fully, consistently jumping into assignments focused on innovation rather than “minding the lever” of past projects, working alongside a highly professional and astute team with IT support that’s lightning fast to jump to your aid, then J. Crew is the place for you.
           This role will lead a test/learn and reporting methodology for marketing pilots. S/he will develop test design and measurements and manage the day-to-day execution of the corresponding analyses. This role will also be responsible for monitoring and interpreting pilot results and suggesting next steps for new pilots or pilot rollout to key stakeholders. S/he should also be comfortable completing and driving ad hoc analyses with manager oversight and coaching.
           It is an exciting time to join J. Crew as we are focused on digital transformation across our brands and channels. We have implemented The Marketing Innovation Lab (The MIL), which is an incubator focused on accelerated test and learn across our on-line and off-line marketing programs. This role will play an integral role managing the test/learn process to support the MIL’s activities.

            Handle missing data through an algorithmic approach such as multiple imputations to enable insights in sparse and messy data.
            Use your inner whiz-kid to feature engineer the data to boost model accuracy
            Education & Experience Requirements
            Master’s degree preferred in statistics or applied mathematics
            At least 5 years previous work experience with strong understanding and proficiency of predictive modeling techniques and test/learn platform experience
