The director must be able to work alongside the mathematicians then bring their models to the user via systems. He or she will put processes in place to ensure quality and efficiency, from ideation through Go To Market every step along the way.
        The director will work with our customers to explain how CCC's products work as well as provide insight based on customer, market, and other CCC products worth consideration. The director will work with outside consultants and professors to complement the team's efforts. Familiarity with evaluating and acquiring third party data is a plus.
