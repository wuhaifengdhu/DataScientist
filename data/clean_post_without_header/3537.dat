        Use your Data Science skills to help people understand what’s happening in the city around them.
Hoodline has built one of the largest locally-focused audiences in San Francisco today, via a neighborhood news editorial operation, and a suite of in-house technology products.
Our city data tools let us break stories about new businesses and developments across neighborhoods, while our content management system makes it easy for our on-the-ground writers to easily tell their neighbors what’s going on.
Now we’re planning new versions of our existing products, and some big new ones for our users — including a more advanced tips line and better city data tools. We’re also planning take what we’ve learned to more cities.
If you get excited about connecting people at the street level through better technology, and perhaps saving local journalism in the process, we’d like to talk.
