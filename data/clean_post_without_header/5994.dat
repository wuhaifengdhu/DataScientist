        Video Fellow
        The BuzzFeed Video Fellowship is a three-month program for the next generation of video producers eager to master the tools and techniques of the social web. Over the course of the program, you will learn how to create compelling, shareable short-form video content. This includes developing production skills from conception to execution - brainstorming, writing, producing, shooting, editing, post-production, notes -- and exploring how and why people view and share videos through BuzzFeed, YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and other social sites.
        You are a native of the digital and pop culture landscape with intimate knowledge of the latest and greatest in emerging technology/platforms. You are obsessed with cultural meme propagation and devour the things people are sharing, liking, recommending and talking about.
        Fellows will work with and learn from members of the BuzzFeed Video team. This is the perfect fellowship for someone interested in pursuing a career in entertainment, new media or creative services, who is fascinated by the web, social networks, human psychology, pop culture, and the changing media landscape.
