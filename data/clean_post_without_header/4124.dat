         Data Scientist - Ads Marketplace
          Who We Are
         The marketplace team oversees the twitter ad auction, which serves billions of ad impressions and generates millions of dollars in revenue per day. Our goal is to generate the maximum value possible from our online auction by matching users with the most valuable and relevant ads. We design and implement new algorithms for ad selection and ranking (e.g. budget-aware allocation, conversion optimization, ranking and relevance improvements). We perform extensive experimentation, simulation, and large-scale log analysis to improve revenue, user experience, and advertiser return on investment.
          Who You Are
         As a Data Scientist you will have an opportunity to directly improve the quality and effectiveness of Twitter ads. You are passionate about understanding data and building algorithms and systems that work at scale. Team members have background in scalable data mining, relevance and ranking, machine learning, experimentation and measurement, statistics, and auction theory.
          What Youâ€™ll Do
           You will apply data mining, machine learning and/or graph analysis techniques for a variety of allocation, modeling, and relevance problems.
           You will perform deep dive analyses to understand the behavior of our ad marketplace and online optimization algorithms.
           You will use Map-Reduce frameworks such as Pig and Scalding, statistical software such as R, and scripting languages like Python and Ruby
           You will write and interpret complex SQL queries for standard as well as ad hoc data mining purposes.
           You will define metrics, understand A/B testing and statistical measurement of algorithm performance.
          If this sounds like you, you probably have:
           Experience with scripting languages like Python or Ruby etc.
           Experience with statistical programming environments like R or Matlab
           Experience in mapping business needs to engineering systems
           Three or more years of industry experience
           Experience with large datasets and map-reduce architectures like Hadoop and open source data mining and machine learning projects
          Requirements
           MS or PhD in computer science, data mining, machine learning, statistics, math, engineering, operations research, or other quantitative discipline
           Fluent in one or more object oriented languages like Java, Scala, C#, C++
