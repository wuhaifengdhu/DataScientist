        Riot Games was established in 2006 by entrepreneurial gamers who believe that player-focused game development can result in great games. In 2009, Riot released its debut title League of Legends to critical and player acclaim. As the most played PC game in the world, over 67 million play every month. Players form the foundation of our community and it's for them that we continue to evolve and improve the League of Legends experience.
        We're looking for humble but ambitious, razor-sharp professionals who can teach us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you take play seriously; you're passionate about games. We embrace those who see things differently, aren't afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints.
        That s where you come in.
        As Technical Data Analyst, you ll provide expertise into bridging business and product needs with data solutions. As data is an integral part of modern life and work, knowing how to collect and use it is incredibly powerful. As TDA who lives at the intersection of engineering, business, and analytics, you'll help unlock data s value and manage it effectively, with a focus towards engineering and business. You'll be both powerful and extremely flexible, helping to achieve Riot's goals of being data-informed company-wide and lending much needed expertise to a wide variety of areas.
        You are:
        * Data-experienced: over the years, you ve earned scars and stripes designing, implementing, and managing data systems for mission critical, large-scale applications; you understand data through-and-through; you have recommendations on how to ingest, model, and partition data and how to maintain a meta store that adheres to high data quality standards
        * Analytical: you re able to expediently identify and analyze problems using a variety of intuitive, logical, and creative methods, but you don t spin your wheels too much, instead move quickly to implement solutions that make our data warehouses much better
        * Business savvy: you can think about data as a product; you understand it is a resource that is valuable to a company and therefore managed properly; as a consumer of data you can also view data from a user s point-of-view; you can help establish and measure data quality, data access, data compliance, and you can tell that story to both engineers and stakeholders of data
        * Consultative: you re comfortable working through ambiguity, seeking out value, and working without close supervision; when we parachute you into a problem space, you'll seek out the best solution and advocate that solution with stakeholders; you re comfortable operating behind enemy lines, clearing the problem s fog of war, and providing relevant intel to aid in decision making
        * Hands-on: you want to work in the kitchen where the data is made; you have no problem working with engineers and talking about data in a way that provides information gain; you are curious about data systems and how data goes from an event to rest and all the transforms in-between while in-flight
        * Player-focused: as a gamer yourself, you know the importance of listening to player needs, especially the implicit needs that can only be uncovered by analyzing and understanding player data
        You will:
        * Function as the SME on enterprise data and set the standard on how to troubleshoot data issues, how to profile source data, how to build out scalable data quality checks, and how to best meet business needs with data
        * Work with data in HDFS, Amazon Redshift, and Vertica, and understand data in a distributed system
        * Ensure the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data, database systems, and supporting services; optimize performance of database and data warehouse infrastructure
        * Work with architects, product managers, and engineers to ensure adherence to best practices and data standards
        * Collaborate with analysts and data scientists as a front line contact for Big Data to help them extract even more value from data, and to help the engineers set data up for maximum value.
        * Act as the technical point of contact for architectural changes and improvements to a world-class data and analytics infrastructure
        Don't forget to include a resume and cover letter. We receive a lot of applications, but we'll notice a fun, well-written intro that shows us you take play seriously.
