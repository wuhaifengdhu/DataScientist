        Bonobos is seeking a Data Scientist to optimize operational and economic inefficiencies and to create practical solutions to business problems using data and technology.
        Bonobos started out as a place for a guy to get a pair of great-fitting pants, and today it's evolved into the largest digitally native vertical apparel brand in the country. Our goal is to become the most loved clothing company of all time. No, seriously.
        As a company born and raised on the internet, the insights we can generate from our data differentiate us from our competitors and give our customers access to a highly personalized shopping experience at scale. By bringing all the great features of our Guideshop locations to the web, we can share the Bonobos experience with every one of our customers, whether or not they live near one of our 30 (and counting) Guideshop locations.
        The mission of the Data Science group is to champion the value of intellectual honesty and data-driven judgment in the organization. We use our data to extract signals that close the loop between our personalized physical shopping experience, our e-commerce platform, and our customers.
        Members of our group are mathematicians and engineers who are motivated by solving problems, flexing their creative muscles to identify opportunities for economic efficiencies, and building practical solutions that scale and address our business needs.
        Some of the solutions we're working on include product recommendations, email targeting models, internal workflow optimization tools, and an intelligence layer that gives our business users the data they need to do their jobs.
