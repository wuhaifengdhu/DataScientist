        D2D: This person will be joining the Quantitative Research and Analytics (QR&A) team to support their Linux/Unix servers. This is a unique position in that they will be collaborating with a separate Unix team, who actually owns the hardware, but responsible for the "user centric" administration. The machines are used by the Data Scientists on the team, but the support they get from the unix team is not sufficient for their needs. So this person will be responsible to the usual troubleshoot and server performance but only in terms of the Data Scientists needs; solving problems such as how to get the data scientists the right packages, setting up the correct firewall rules for their needs, and removing any other barriers. They trick as that since they will not own the hardware, they do not have the root access that is typically for most administrators. Instead, they must collaborate with the unix team and be the "voice" for the QR&A team. Strong communication, documentation skills, and user-centric mentality is necessary for this person to succeed.
