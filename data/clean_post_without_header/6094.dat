        The Division of Environmental Health in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California is seeking a research associate with expertise in geospatial models of air pollution exposure in population health studies.
        We seek a motivated individual with doctorate-level academic training in the environmental health sciences and demonstrated competence in geographic information systems, spatiotemporal models, geospatial statistics, and the use of satellite imagery and aerosol optical depth data in models of air pollutants and source-resolved exposures. A strong background in data analysis and statistical modeling is required for this cross-cutting position within our multidisciplinary Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center. Demonstrated abilities to process, manage and analyze large data sets using statistical software packages and programming languages (eg., SAS, R, ArcGIS, Matlab, ENVI, etcâ€¦), publish peer-reviewed manuscripts and to deliver technical presentations at professional meetings are important prerequisites.
        This appointment will be under the supervision of Dr. Rima Habre, in the "Life course Approach to Developmental Repercussions of Environmental Agents on MEtabolic and Respiratory health" (LA DREAMERs)" research program as part of the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) NIH initiative and additional grant funded projects. The successful candidate will be motivated, collegial, technically resourceful, and practically grounded.
        A dynamic and diverse group of investigators in the Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center (SCEHSC), housed in the Department of Preventive Medicine, also offers opportunities for a wide range of research collaborations with investigators at UCLA and other southern California institutions. The NIEHS-funded SCEHSC features an innovative Career Development Program for early investigators to strengthen their skills and knowledge base needed for career advancement (e.g., developing career directions and priorities, grant writing, making effective presentations, preparing manuscripts, and developing multidisciplinary research teams). The program has established a track record of success in helping junior investigators to obtain faculty positions and a first NIH award. U.S. citizenship or permanent residency is not required.
        The University of Southern California strongly values diversity and is committed to equal opportunity in employment. Women and men, and members of all racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities, and veterans are encouraged to apply.
