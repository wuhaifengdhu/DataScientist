        Position Description â€“ Methodologist
        This senior-level contributor serves as the "architect" who directs the creation, implementation, maintenance and enhancement of a given methodology (model, algorithm, measurement approach, etc.), and acts as the highest level of Subject Matter Expert (SME) for a given methodology. This individual will interface with product managers and business leaders to define practical requirements for new methods and models, and translate these to a level of specificity that can be interpreted by a data scientist and/or software engineer. The methodologist will also translate complex technical or clinical concepts into formats that are easily understood by a typical audience of internal and external customers. A successful Methodologist will have strong skills in the technical disciplines, a foundational understanding of clinical terminology and concepts, and an overall understanding of care delivery and payment systems. While they do not need to be a statistical or clinical expert, they will work closely with those resources and must understand the appropriate questions to be asked and approaches to be evaluated in doing so. The Methodologist should be very comfortable performing detailed analysis on large disparate datasets using a variety of tools and evaluating the results of applied algorithms and statistical models.
