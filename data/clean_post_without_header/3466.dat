        We are looking for a senior data scientist with deep machine learning experience. Someone who will be able to work both independently and with the rest of the data science and engineering teams to help keep the statistics behind what we do on the cutting edge.
        We want someone who is self-reliantâ€”able to do most of the research and scripting with only minimal input from engineering during the research phase, and who can be heavily involved in implementation and debugging during the production phase, but no need to contribute production code.
        Primary Responsibilities
        * Improving our core algorithms with respect to modeling, feature selection, correlation, etc.
        * Formulate new modeling problems; researching and helping to implement new products.
        * Improving signal extraction; for example better web-crawling.
        * Evaluating and incorporating sources of data from external vendors.
        * Explore various holes in our current modeling infrastructure. For example, improved modeling targets.
        * Debug / improve models for specific high-value customers.
