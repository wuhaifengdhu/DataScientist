          Responsibilities:
          • Work with NIH data to understand NIH research, disease, conditions (RCDC) categorization needs using natural language processing (NLP) tools, medical thesauri/terminologies, clustering or statistical machine learning tools.
          • Develop new algorithms and methods for optimizing the RCDC categorization process
          • Rapidly test hypotheses by developing prototypes and running experiments
          • Generate actionable insights by analyzing large amounts of data and using analytical rigor, predictive modeling, cluster analysis, temporal analysis, and other techniques.
          • Evaluate commercial and open source techniques and technologies in Machine Learning, Data Mining, NLP, and Analytics
          • Build scalable and high performance machine learning and data mining algorithms
         Qualifications:
          Required Skills:
          B.S. in computer science, computational linguistics or related field from an accredited university with courses in computer science, computational linguistics, statistics, mathematical statistics, or probability theory
          • Demonstrated proficiency in Java and SQL

          • Must be able to work independently
          • Must have an inquisitive mindset
          • Must have strong analytical and problem solving skills
          • Must have strong oral and written communication skills
          • Ability to work effectively in a multidisciplinary team setting
          Desired Skills:
          • Experience with text mining, machine learning software
          • Experience with several of the following NLP subdomains: named entity recognition, semantic and grammatical disambiguation, negation and uncertainty identification, relationship extraction, temporal relationship extraction, information extraction, spelling error identification and recovery, ontological reasoning, text mining
          • Experience with the following NLP tasks: tokenization, part of speech tagging, morphological decomposition, chunking, segmentation, regular expressions
          • Experience with machine learning algorithms
          • Experience working with large bodies of text
          • Considerable practical experience in quantitative analysis
          • Proficiency programming in a statistical language (e.g., Stata, SAS, R, MATLAB, GAUSS, Mathematica)
          • A proven high level of organizational and communication skills
          • Demonstrated ability to work effectively in a multidisciplinary team setting
          • Demonstrated ability to provide training at various levels
          • Demonstrated experience preparing conference presentations, research findings, and manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed journals
          • Ability to conduct independent research and to form internal and external collaborations in support of research initiatives in conjunction with a multi-disciplinary team in a fast-paced environment
          A strong interest in topics related to medical research, health and disability, related programs and policies, and/or health services.
          Requires US Citizen or US Person (Green Card Holder) with the ability to obtain a Public Trust Clearance.
