        Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is funding an ambitious initiative to acceleratecancer research. The Oracle Cancer Research Cloud (OCRC) will provide cancer researchersa private cloud and a shared data warehouse in which to conduct their research.The data warehouse will be prepopulated with large volumes of genomic data andother cancer related data. In return Oracle data scientists will curate andanonymize research data and add it to the data warehouse. This will expand theknowledge base available to other academic researchers, as well as pharmaceuticalresearchers, insurance companies and clinicians providing patient care. Ourgoal is to use our vast infrastructure to make research more efficient, butalso to provide the means for all cancer clinicians to have access to thelatest research so they can deliver the best available care to their patients.
        Department Description:
        We hire exceptional people and trust them to do theirjobs with minimal oversight. Our team will be building the cloud infrastructureand populating the data warehouse from established data sources. Our datascientists use cutting edge techniques for data ingestion, curation and integrationof all data related to cancer research and treatment. Our cloud team uses agileDevOps practices to build and manage the Cancer Research Cloud on the OracleBare Metal cloud infrastructure. Our application development and UI teams useAgile development practices to build the applications that will be used daily byresearch scientists, clinical oncologists and other user communities.
        Position Overview:
        The Cloud Architecture, Development and Operations teamis looking for several experienced Data Management engineers or DBAs who willbe responsible for managing tens of Petabytes of data in the Oracle Bare MetalCloud. We will be using a mix of SQL and No-SQL databases and data managementtechnologies to support reliable data ingestion, curation, anonymization anddurable storage of truly vast amounts of data. Understanding data architecture,database design and security principles is a must. Ability to work with scientificresearchers, data scientists and DevOps engineers is a must. Experience workingin an agile (scrum or Kanban) team is a requirement. Experience with Oracledatabase 12.c is required and experience with Oracle Exadata is highlydesirable, however
        generalists with depth in multiple databases and datatechnologies are highly desired. Automated provisioning and managementexperience is desirable. Experience working with scientists or in a medicalindustry/clinical setting is a plus.
        Job Responsibilities:
        Data engineering team members will be responsible for ensuringdata access and durability for all OCRC applications. This requires the abilityto work within an agile team framework and to focus on details while beingaware of the bigger picture. The team may be geographically distributed, so strongteamwork is needed. The successful candidates will be expected to work alone,or with other team members to deliver projects from the team backlog and toconfigure and manage many databases and datasets. Early on they will workextensively with the science community to understand schemas for the variousdata sources and perform database design. They will develop ETL jobs and datapipeline jobs to ingest and store data in a variety of databases and formats. Thelargest, highest performance data will be stored in Oracle Exadata. Other SQLdata will be in Oracle 12c or MySQL. No-SQL and object store data will be in avariety of formats. Over time we will need to develop strategies for performinglifecycle management on petabytes of data. Creativity is expected. Most of theworkday will be project work but we will be required to respond to clients orother team members on an "as-needed" basis.
