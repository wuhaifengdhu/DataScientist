        The Einstein Data Science team at Salesforce is looking for senior data connoisseurs particularly with modeling experience, to help us take one of the world's most extensive data sets and transform it into amazing products that feel like magic.
        A typical day for you might include the following:
        * Develop best in class infrastructure that is able to ingest and transform data at huge scale coming from many different sources in many different varieties.
        * Develop machine learning infrastructure and models that can generalize across hundreds of thousands of Salesforce customers, but is expressive enough to actually generate high lift.
        * Brainstorm data product ideas with the data scientists that built some of the most exciting data products that hundreds of millions people use every day.
        * Meeting with external customers and understanding their businesses and their challenges.
        * Working with internal product teams to transform and sprinkle machine learning fairy dust on their products.
        * Participate in meal conversations with your team members about really important topics, such as: Should the cuteness of panda bears be a factor in their survivability? Is love a decision tree or a regression model? How far ahead would society be today if we had 12 fingers instead of 10?
        What we care about:
        * You have industry experience with Spark / Scala and data modeling. Preference for 5+ years of industry experience (without PhD); at least 2-3 years of industry experience with PhD.
        * You have to love data - this is what we do. We are looking for people who are excited about different and unique data sets, and all the ways that they could be used in order to improve user experience.
        * You have to be self sufficient - we operate like a startup, so everyone needs to do a bit of everything. A bit of design, product specs, front end, back end. You don't need to be an expert, but you need to not shy away from these tasks.
        * The only exception, is coding. We develop real products, and most of it is writing code. You need to be an expert in coding.
        * You have to want to make a difference - we don't like status quo. We are looking for people who want to excel at everything they do, while still being able to prioritize between the must-haves and nice-to-haves.
        * You have to be a very quick learner - we face new challenges every day, anything that ranges between the operating model of a financial services companies to how to make Spark work with the S3 file system. No school could prepare you for all of these, so you need to be very quick on your feet.
