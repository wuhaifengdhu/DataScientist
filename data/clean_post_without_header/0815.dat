          We are looking for a talented Data Scientist to ensure that we serve up the best video at the best time to every single Spiral viewer. As part of our mission to inform, inspire, and educate the world with great video content, we want our video feed to adapt to each userâ€™s personal patterns and preferences. In practice this means building out video rankings, recommendation systems, and predictive algorithms for watching behavior depending on time, location, social signals, and previous activity.
          Our ideal candidate is comfortable in a fluid, fast-paced startup environment and will bring an energetic, fun and creative approach to their work. You should have experience building product features from the ground up, and not be afraid to make iterative moves or deal with imperfect data. You should be comfortable running side-experiments to determine the optimal approach while working with engineering to contribute directly to production code. And while you should be comfortable with large datasets, you should also be ready to make an impact while the data is still limited. As our first Data Scientist, you will determine the quality of the watching experience for Spiral.
           What you'll be doing:
             Work closely with product and other members of engineering to apply machine learning.
             Design and run iterative experiments to determine the best approach to relevance ranking.
             Enable improved contextual recommendations and content discovery.
           What you have:
             Advanced degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Machine Learning, Statistics, Mathematics, or related field.
             3+ years experience as a Data Scientist or Data Engineer.
             Extensive experience in NLP, video analysis, machine learning, and/or bayesian inference.
             Comfortable with all the usual: SQL, R, Greek letters, etc.
             Create production level code Ability to work with big datasets with minimal engineering support.
             Excitement around taking ownership of problems in a luxurious, fast-paced environment.
