         The Sr. TPM Intelligence Officer is a key role within the TPM Intelligence team, a part of the larger Chief Third Party Management Office.  The Chief Third Party Management Office has the responsibility to oversee the end to end management of Third Parties both External to Citi and Inter-affiliates owned by Citi.
         The role actively drives efforts to advance CTPMO’s assessment of internal and external third-party data and deliver meaningful information to the broader TP Risk & Control teams, as well as to the executive and business management groups. A key focus area for this role is the identification of effective ways to monitor third-party landscape and control environment through risk modeling, development/evaluation, reporting tools and analysis on data sets representing approximately 17,000 external Third Party relationships and over 400 Inter-affiliate services spread across nearly 200 countries globally.
         This effort calls for close partnership with several other groups around the globe; most notably Enterprise Supply Chain, Finance (Inter Affiliate Risk Management Services) and sector and regional TPM teams. Through such collaborative efforts, the Senior TPM Intelligence Officer contributes to the thought leadership of the group by leveraging existing information, identifying new channels of data, and developing new and enhanced insights that can be helpful to Citi businesses’ use and management of third parties as well as their strategic and tactical decisions.
         Given the growing importance of TPM intelligence, this role is also critical in providing in-depth and sophisticated analysis with interpretive thinking to address emerging problems and develop innovative solutions. Such efforts are also expected to drive CTPMO’s development of risk modeling capabilities and operationalizing their application.
