        We are looking for full-time instructors:
        Our Web Development Immersive course is a life-changing educational experience where our students learn the skills and mindsets to take on new careers as web developers. We are looking for Instructor Associates with strong Python experience to play a key role at our Atlanta Campus.
        Why teach our Data Science Immersive?
        If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for data science with the next generation, we'd love for you to consider joining our team. As an instructional associate in our DSI course, you will have the opportunity to shape the vision and delivery of the course materials.
        We deliver more than just skills training, and are looking for teachers who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love. As a full-time instructional associate for our flagship full-time web development program, you will work with our instructional team to:
        * Work closely with one or more Lead Instructors to guide students through a rigorous, transformational journey towards apprenticeship in software development.
        * Become a better teacher, leader, and mentor as you learn from veteran instructors and our world-class instructional coaches.
        * Inspire and support students as they identify their passions and drive their own continued learning beyond the curriculum.
        * Adapt our global curriculum and use it to guide your teaching, building your own lesson plans as needed and contributing back your lessons learned over time.
        * Facilitate a safe, supportive, and energetic community that welcomes the various needs and learning styles of your students.
        * Identify and implement best practices for using online resources to maximize student engagement
        What do we teach?
        We adapt both our global curriculum and local approach to the technical trends and hiring environment of the times and cities we work in, but for our online program our primary educational approach centers around Python and SQL. In general, our curriculum is scaffolded to follow the historical evolution of data science. The course will primarily focus on Python and SQL, and students will have the opportunity to learn about R and Machine learning. We also cover all sorts of other things that junior data scientists need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.
        We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.
