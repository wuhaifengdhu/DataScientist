        Greetings, students! We're geared up here to offer another round of epic internship experiences in summer 2017. The internship program offers the opportunity to pause your studies for one summer and work side-by-side with Blizzard Entertainment employees in your area of interest, doing real work that oftentimes ends up in production. As such, we hold you to the same high standards as anybody else in the company.
        Just like our gameplay experiences, Blizzard internships are a fully immersive experience. We want interns who are enthusiastic about what they want to do for a living and excited to come in every day to learn and contribute in this hyper-creative atmosphere. Being fully engaged with our team also means communicating effectively and maintaining an open mind - one that is receptive to feedback and able to adapt and grow. Your hobbies and interests can also play in your favor. Passion for technology, gaming, game development, and an in-depth knowledge of Blizzard games, products, and services will always be a plus with us, regardless of the position you're applying for. Be passionate about who you are, be into our industry, and be willing to go all-in and embrace this opportunity to the fullest!
        Quest Objectives
        The data engineering team has constructed more pylons and is now seeking an intern who is eager to level up his or her capabilities as a member of our team: to challenge him- or herself with cutting edge technology in the big data space; to build out his or her professional foundation with the fundamentals of data warehousing, data pipeline design, and systems architecting; and to contribute to the data engineers' win rate in Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch scrimmages against the analysts teams. Our intern will be working alongside our data engineers for hands-on experience and some Deckard Cain-style greybeard wisdom and will have a unique opportunity to pair with either our business and gameplay insights analysts or our data scientists to work on a project that will bring immediate value to Blizzard as a whole.
        The data engineering intern will spend the summer seeing a project end-to-end, much as our data engineers do on a daily basis: gathering and refining requirements with their analyst or data scientist, translating those requirements into an actionable technical plan, working with the project managers to develop a project plan, and then executing against that plan to deliver a final product that will be presented to the business intelligence team for possible inclusion in our production environments.
        This is a unique and powerful opportunity for an aspiring data engineer to see a full project end-to-end, working closely with stakeholders at various levels and interests throughout the company: senior data engineers, data scientists, business analysts, and gameplay designers and engineers.
