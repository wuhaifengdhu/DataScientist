        What You'll Do
        You will collaborate with colleagues and clients to create new strategies across a wide platform of projects, from customer life-cycle management, MROI, pricing and promotions, marketing mix modeling, to analytic transformation.
        You will help to expand our current analytic capabilities and architect new strategies and applications within a dynamic innovative organization. You will shape the future of what data-driven organizations look like, drive processes for extracting and using that data in creative ways, and create new lines of thinking within an infinite number of clients and situations, with an eye on optimizing every aspect of our clients' marketing practices.
        Through the measurement, manipulation, reporting and dissemination of broad sets of data, you will create valuable, transformative business strategies. You'll apply and advise teams on the state-of-the-art advanced analytic and quantitative tools and modeling techniques in order to derive business insights, solve complex business problems and improve decisions.

        You'll also have the opportunity to lead and support the development of knowledge for our firm's analytic group. You may do this by creating a roadmap for a greater understanding of analytics and its impact in the consulting population or by partnering with other analytic consultants to ensure timely and effective methods of the extraction, assembly and transfer of broad, complex sets of data.
