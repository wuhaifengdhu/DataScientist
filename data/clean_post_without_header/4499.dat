             We are looking for an experienced and enthusiastic data scientist for our novel general-purpose AI platform. Our platform is a recommendation and decision engine that builds learning knowledge graphs across a variety of information classes and customer verticals. The platform ingests and organizes data into networks involving data, people, objects and actions. The platform learns, optimizes, and provides a real-time interaction system for querying recommendations and relations, along with dynamic analytics about uncovered connections. Top companies use the platform across the enterprise from direct customer product and offer recommendations to back-end corporate decision support needs.
             Many of us come from scientific backgrounds and seek a counterpart in a data scientist who will be actively supported in helping to organize and apply best practices to our data, seeking patterns and insights. You must have a strong analytical background and solid experience with hypothesis formation, evaluation through multi-dimensional data analysis, and communication of results in a visually exciting manner. You will produce analyses and solutions to complement our recommendation engine, for example:
              show key business results that demonstrates the benefits of our technology as being used by our current and future customers in diverse and interesting verticals
              generate dashboards on platform efficacy
              distill results to guide further algorithm development
              discover patterns in the data and consequent networks that indicate where our platform is uncovering signal vs. noise
              determine proper testing for customer problems and lead the results analysis
              collaborate across the team to create infographics and analyses in support of PR and thought leadership efforts
              Our culture:
              We are a small, close, highly technical team. You need to be self-motivated and self-managed.
              Our customers are top global companies. You need to have the skills required to analyze results and present them professionally to customer teams and high-level executives.
              This is an intelligence platform, and you’ve got to be smarter than it. Problem solving skills are a must. A mathematical background is an asset in the types of conceptual challenges that we routinely face.
              This is a highly technical team. Everyone keeps up with and teaches one another. We communicate in code and prose; you should too.
              While many skills are transferable, the ability to find and invent creative approaches must be in your toolset.

             BENEFITS
              About Us:
             We are a fast growing artificial intelligence company, developing “synaptic intelligence” for connecting data to decisions. We have built and continue to refine a novel, general purpose pipeline for connecting dynamic neural networks to significant business problems. We have established customers in some of the world’s largest companies, across multiple interesting verticals such as health, finance, travel and entertainment, e-commerce, and government. For these customers, we automatically organize data for general recommendations (i.e., “Pandora for many categories”) and decisions (e.g. Siri, Watson, Echo). With an MIT heritage, we have a great Cambridge office right in the heart of Kendall Square. We are cultivating a great team of optimistic and productive people to develop a new framework for organizing knowledge and help make smarter decisions.
              What We Offer:
              Purpose – building a new AI technology that advances the art and makes peoples’ lives better through more informed decisions for society and better recommendations.
              $$$ – a salary that is geared to retaining top talent like you, with comprehensive benefits, in a stable startup
              Stock – incentive stock options in a company poised for near-term growth

              What We Are Doing:
              We are contributing to a new form of artificial intelligence to find commonalities and connections in data for the purpose of recommendations across general categories of knowledge
              We are inspired by the latest neuroscience research to support our quest to pull out the signal from the noise in big data
              We are creating new types of dynamic interfaces and APIs to make this easy to use for solving real business problems
              We are guided by a keen focus on data analytics that drives business decisions for our customers and ourselves.
