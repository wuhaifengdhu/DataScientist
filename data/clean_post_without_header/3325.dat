        In the Connexity Audience Solutions Data Science Group, we build and maintain the analytic machinery (pipelines and processes) that generates and optimizes audiences for our clients. We ingest big data (~100Bs of records) and use machine learning methods to guarantee that the right consumers see the right advertisements. We're a small team, focused on creating big value across Connexity's audience products.
        We're looking for a Senior Data Scientist & Analytic Engineer, a magical hybrid of quant and engineering disciplines, to join us in advancing the development of new and existing analytic audience products. If you are passionate about data and solving business challenges with math and software development…if you want to move the needle by building, owning, and maintaining the production systems that directly drive revenue…if you've got the multidisciplinary chops for this business value-oriented role…then we should talk.

        * Experience owning the complete modeling life cycle from data exploration, feature management, model building, and evaluation.
        * Experience with big data tools (Map/Reduce, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, etc.).
        * Fluency with one or more high-level programming languages (Python, Scala, Java, C, C++)
        * Ability to build quick prototypes to demonstrate value – and then improve them.
        * Proficiency in Linux (shell tools, scripting, and basic admin).
        * Ability to communicate complex ideas in data science to relevant stakeholders.
        * Excellent organization skills and attention to detail.
        * Collaborative, positive attitude with desire to work in a demanding, fast-paced, and dynamic work environment.
