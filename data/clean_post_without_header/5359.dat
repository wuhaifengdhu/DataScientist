        The University of Pennsylvania's Product Development & Correlative Sciences laboratory (http://somapps.med.upenn.edu/pdcs/) at Dr. Carl June's Center for Cellular Immunotherapies (http://www.med.upenn.edu/cci/) is seeking a talented, experienced, and highly motivated bioinformatician/data scientist with a keen interest in translational immunology and a track record in deriving biological insight into response to therapies from clinical and correlative analyses. As a member of the correlative sciences community at CCI this position will collaborate very closely with data scientists and clinicians in PDCS and across CCI, and at UPenn, and domestic and international collaborators, aimed at expanding our world-class analytical pipeline in support of ever-improving patient outcomes and scale-out of therapies pioneered at UPenn.
        Our group supports clinical trials evaluating novel gene therapies (see http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/06/human-crispr-trial-proposed as an example) with cutting-edge cellular, biochemical, and molecular analytics, including RNA-seq and ATAC-seq in bulk populations and single cells, and high dimensional flow and mass cytometry and targeted proteomics. This, together with clinical response evaluations and laboratory data, creates unique data sets for the exploration of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the biomarkers and create network models to understand the biology of our therapy and develop predictive models of therapy potency and toxicity (e.g. PMID 27076371, 26333935). This position requires a self-motivated individual with strong interpersonal skills, who thrives in a team and matrix organization. There is a strong focus on the implementation of analytics pipelines for high dimensional data sets derived from comprehensive, multi-layered data sets to understand and predict response to our targeted therapy.
