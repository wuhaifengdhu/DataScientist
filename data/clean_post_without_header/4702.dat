            Weâ€™re looking for a data-savvy individual to join our team as a data scientist, to create consumer-focused research content and support user-centric product development and growth based on our real-time feed of billions of flight search results along with an archive of several trillion data points.
            You may be a great fit for our team if you are excited about exploring huge (and sometimes messy) data sets and finding effective ways to simplify and communicate the results to a non-technical audience.
             We're looking for someone to fill this role in a full-time capacity immediately, so unfortunately we are unable to consider 2016 degree candidates at this time.
             In this role you will
             Transform complex analyses into short, compelling, and easy to understand studies to share with journalists aimed at a consumer audience
             Frame and conduct complex analyses and experiments using tremendously large (e.g. 10^6 to 10^10 records), complex (not always well-structured, highly variable) data sets
             Design and implement ad hoc and automated analysis scripts, design and deliver appropriate summary tables, charts and interactive tools to present your results
            Requirements
             A qualified candidate has
             A degree in Math, Statistics, Computer Science, Engineering or other quantitative discipline
             Extremely strong analytical and problem-solving skills
             Proven ability to communicate complex technical work to a non-technical audience
             A strong passion for and extensive experience in conducting empirical research and answering hard questions with data
             Experience with relational databases and SQL, especially Hive
             Experience working with extremely large data sets
             Experience in Pandas, R, SAS or other tools appropriate for large scale data preparation and analysis
             Experience with data mining, machine learning, statistical modeling tools and underlying algorithms
             Proficiency with Unix/Linux environments
            Sound like a fit? We can't wait to hear from you.
