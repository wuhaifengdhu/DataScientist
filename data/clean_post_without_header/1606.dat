        Who are you?
        * You are a Scientist: you apply statistical rigor to your analyses and check your results against a battery of tests (like the Common Sense test) before publishing.
        * You are a Statistician: you know which statistical test to apply in every situation, you know the best fit distribution curve, you know the meaning of p-values, and you wince whenever someone confuses correlation with causation.
        * You are a Philosopher: you imbue your applications with sentience via ML, and your chief disciples are Regression, Bayesian, Decision Tree, Clustering, et al.
        * You are an Artist: you create visually compelling reports and dashboards that make Edward Tufte weep. You are capable of forging complex charts if necessary, but understand the simple elegance with which a bar graph can communicate ideas.
        * You are an Economist: you have a nose for efficiency and the bottom line, and effectively keep at bay the haunting specter of analysis paralysis. You can distill complex analytical results to a few bullet points so people can walk away after five minutes with a good summary of your findings.
        * You are a DIY black belt: you are unafraid to get your hands dirty and build a brand new data pipeline from scratch. You are able to quickly pick up new technologies and are willing to do what it takes to surface data to provide valuable insights.
        * You are a grizzled veteran: you most likely have 5+ years of experience as a data scientist in a dynamic environment, but if you don't you make up for it with an unparalleled ability to educate yourself and actuate on this learning.
        * You are an Olympian: you are fitness-oriented. You like to run, leap, climb, swim, etc. in some capacity in your spare time, and/or you have a fundamental understanding of why others like to run, leap, climb, swim, etc.
