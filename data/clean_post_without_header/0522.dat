        Our capabilities are the foundation to multiple high profile initiatives and have been essential to the Healthcare practice in delivering organization wide transformation programs for payors (public and private) or providers. The HA&D team has grown to 160+ colleagues globally over the last 4 years. It is a unique mix of Healthcare Experts, physicians, statisticians, engineers, data scientists, and more.
        McKinsey New Ventures fosters innovation driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile and social by developing new products/services and integrating them into our client work. It is helping to shift our model toward asset-based consulting and is a foundation for –and expands our investment in –our entrepreneurial culture. Through innovative software as a service solutions, strategic acquisitions, and a vibrant ecosystem of alliances, we are redefining what it means to work with McKinsey.
        As one of the fastest-growing parts of our firm, New Ventures has more than 1,500 dedicated professionals (including more than 800 analysts and data scientists) and we're hiring more mathematicians, data scientists, designers, software engineers, product managers, client development managers and general managers.

You will identify and communicate insights and implications to clients, and develop business recommendations.
        You will develop a knowledge base and library that captures the industry data landscape and the content expertise of using the datasets. You will maintain relationships with a defined portfolio of clients and advise them on how to drive impact using deployed tools (after initial delivery is complete).
        You will coach, train, and troubleshoot for clients, and maintain best practices materials, manage commercial aspects of ongoing relationship (e.g., invoicing), and will be responsible for maintaining and extending relationships and subscriptions.
