        Riot Games was established in 2006 by entrepreneurial gamers who believe that player-focused game development can result in great games. In 2009, Riot released its debut title League of Legends to critical and player acclaim. As the most played PC game in the world, over 100 million play every month. Players form the foundation of our community and it's for them that we continue to evolve and improve the League of Legends experience.
        We're looking for humble but ambitious, razor-sharp professionals who can teach us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you take play seriously; you're passionate about games. We embrace those who see things differently, aren't afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints.
        That s where you come in.
        As Technical Data Analyst, you ll provide expertise into bridging business and product needs with data solutions.

You'll be integral in defining and maintaining data quality, in providing solutions for data in flight and at rest.
        You are:
        * Data-experienced: over the years, you ve earned scars and stripes designing, implementing and managing data systems for mission critical, large-scale applications; you understand data through-and-through; you have recommendations on how to ingest, model, and configure databases and tables to enable efficient access based on project requirements
        * Analytical: you re able to expediently identify and analyze problems using a variety of intuitive, logical, and creative methods, but you don t spin your wheels too much, instead moving quickly to implement solutions

You re comfortable operating behind enemy lines, clearing the problem s fog of war, providing relevant intel to aid in decision making
        * Diverse: your skillset is broad, born from a need of adopting whatever tech was relevant to solve a problem. You use the command line to quickly bend messy data to your will. Python or other programming languages are the cauldron in which you convert data to gold
        * Technical: you want to work in the kitchen where the data is made; you have no problem working with engineers and are curious about data systems and how data goes from an event to rest and all the transforms in-between while in-flight
        * Player-focused: as a gamer yourself, you know the importance of listening to player needs, especially the implicit needs that can only be uncovered by analyzing and understanding player data
