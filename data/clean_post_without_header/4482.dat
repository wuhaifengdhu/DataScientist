         Located in Boston and the surrounding communities, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute brings together world renowned clinicians, innovative researchers and dedicated professionals, allies in the common mission of conquering cancer, HIV/AIDS and related diseases. Combining extremely talented people with the best technologies in a genuinely positive environment, we provide compassionate and comprehensive care to patients of all ages; we conduct research that advances treatment; we educate tomorrow's physician/researchers; we reach out to underserved members of our community; and we work with amazing partners, including other Harvard Medical School-affiliated hospitals.
         The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute seeks a POSTDOCTORAL COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGIST AND DATA SCIENTIST FELLOW, under the Van Allen lab (
         ) and the Center for Cancer Precision Medicine (http://www.dana-farber.org/newsroom/news-releases/joint-center-for-cancer-precision-medicine-established.aspx) to work on the analysis of new datasets generated in the context of multiple clinically oriented cancer sequencing projects in order help advance efforts for precision cancer medicine.
         The qualified candidate will specifically focus on new algorithms for the clinical integration of whole transcriptome (RNA) sequencing with existing exome/genome (DNA) sequencing to enable new discoveries in patients under multiple contexts. The candidate will also evaluate and integrate existing tools and databases into high-throughput pipelines, and facilitate the display and the distribution of processed data.
         These projects include:
          Prospective clinical sequencing to guide the care of cancer patients
          Studies of RNA-based drivers of cancer development and treatment response (alternative splicing, differential gene expression)
          Studies of patient samples for tumor behavior and clinical outcomes in context of immunotherapy
          Creation of new algorithms that effectively integrate RNA sequencing data for clinical utility
         These projects are collaborative efforts between the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Broad Institute, and multiple other institutions.  The goals of this initiative consist of analyzing sequencing data to determine the effects of genomic alterations and expression changes on clinical behavior, both retrospectively and prospectively.  These new data could help identify novel approaches for personalized care in oncology.  In addition, this data may provide support for new methods in clinical decision-making, biomarkers for rational drug development, and new insights into tumor biology through innovative analyses.
         The person hired for this position will join the team in this effort, and will participate in the design and implementation of algorithms to analyze the data and integrate with other data sets including clinical outcomes data. This person will also help with the generation of tools needed for manipulating and preparing data for display; transferring data to external collaborators and data repositories; and will also help maintain, support, and document shared tools, code base, and data sets. As the software infrastructure evolves, this position is likely to present diverse and flexible opportunities - from deeper and more complex software design problems, to becoming more involved in the bioinformatic and analytic aspects of predictive modeling.
         Requirements:  A top-tier Ph.D. in bioinformatics, genetics, statistics, mathematical, physical, or computer science, or comparable research experience, together with significant experience in computer programming and computational biological applications. A strong background in statistics and biology. Experience managing and curating large datasets and with machine learning techniques desired. Excellent oral and written communication skills and the ability to perform both self-directed and guided research are required. Must demonstrate outstanding personal initiative and the ability to work effectively as part of a team. Ability to meet deadlines and efficiently multitask is a must.
