        Sprinklr is 1300 employees strong, valued at $1.8 billion, and one of the fastest growing companies in the history of enterprise software. In the age of the empowered and connected customer, we know that every experience a customer has with a brand matters...a lot.
        That's why -- from the very beginning -- Sprinklr set out to build a powerful, agnostic, and first-of-its-kind, social operating system that integrates with an organization's existing tech infrastructure and allows employees across the front office to collaborate more effectively and deliver superior customer experiences across every social channel.
        Today, we're revolutionizing customer engagement in 75+ countries for more than 1000 of the most recognized brands, including Nike, JPMorgan Chase, Verizon, McDonalds, Microsoft, P&G, Uber, and more than 50% of the Fortune 50. We've spent the last six years building the world's most complete enterprise social technology.
        Now we're leveraging that market-leading position to help the biggest brands on the planet take on one of the largest opportunities ever in enterprise software: unifying the front office.
        And we're bringing the very best talent in the world together to get there.
        What We Need
        We need someone who wants to "own it". You'll be responsible for working with your Partner Marketing leaders to build a marketing plan that drives objectives around complete and total domination of the Microsoft ecosystem while simultaneously staying true to the corporate marketing strategy and core values of the company overall.
        You'll be responsible for heavily leveraging corporate marketing and creating market specific activities to drive results with our partners at Microsoft. Always, focused on driving results, your outcomes will be centered on building awareness and perception of the Sprinklr brand and quantifiable lead generation by leveraging, "To, Though, For and With" marketing tactics.
        On a day-to-day basis, you can expect that you will be involved in:
        * Ensuring that "no lead is left behind." when it comes to the Microsoft channel. Everything is followed up on and tracked. No exceptions
        * Constantly exploring improvements to the systems and processes used to track and follow up on those leads
        * Planning, executing, and following up on Sprinklr / Microsoft events and conferences/trade-shows in which we participate
        * Working with the corporate content marketing team to ensure that relevant content lands locally and is distributed within the partnership for which you are responsible
        * Nurturing partner relationships and ensuring a deep collaborative alignment with your counterparts at Microsoft
        * Holding sales accountable for leveraging marketing material and executing in support of marketing activities
        * Serve as the "voice of the partner" in helping to shape corporate marketing strategy and direction
        Requirements
        Here's what you will need to prove that you know how to do.
        * 8+ years of experience in Partner Marketing, experience with Microsoft preferred.
        * Data analysis (Excel) and Presentation creation and delivery (PowerPoint.) But not just the lightweight kind. You need to not only have a designer's eye, but a data scientist's mind. Have you ever created a Pivot Table, can you identify meaningful metrics?
        * Almost anyone can write, but not everyone can write well. Clear, concise, convincing. That's what we need. We'll want you to demonstrate that early on.
        * If people don't like you, you just won't be very effective in the role.
        * The ability to meet deadlines in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
        * The ability to work autonomously, be proactive, and take initiative and do so within the structure of the organization and guidance of your leadership
        * Relevant partner marketing experience.
