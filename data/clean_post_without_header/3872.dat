        Join a tight-knit team at Microsoft and change the way people work by making Yammer a better product. At Yammer, we're building software that's revolutionizing the typical workday. Yammer makes it easy for people (at desks, on planes, in stores, and all over) to tap into their network and all the would-be collaborators and hard-to-find resources across their organization and work together.
        Yammer relies on data to influence decisions across the organization and our Analytics Team plays a central role in making that happen.
        HERE'S WHERE YOU COME IN:
        We're looking for Data Scientists who want their work to have an impact. You've got a brain and Yammer's all about you using it to achieve that impact. If you enjoy thinking critically, questioning assumptions, and collaborating with intelligent folks, we think you'd also enjoy this role.
        Here are a few reasons why we love this job:
        Autonomy: We're independent thinkers and we each have the freedom to make our own decisions. In addition we each own our projects.
        Teamwork: We value autonomy but that doesn't mean we work alone. Each analyst has unique strengths and viewpoints and we often teach each other new skills and explore alternative perspectives.
        High Expectations: Our coworkers rarely ignore our analyses. Rather, they poke holes in them and challenge us to produce stronger, more convincing analyses.
        MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU'LL DO
        Day-to-day work varies, but here are common tasks you should expect:
        * Collaborate with Product Managers and Engineers to define and measure success of new features
        * Influence priorities by estimating the potential impact of projects
        * Triage problems with our product using data about user behavior
        WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
        * Problem Solving: You find creative ways to make it to the finish line even when roadblocks arise and even when the problem is ambiguously defined.
        * Good Communication: You can explain complex concepts in simple terms. You can also translate numbers into words and words into decisions.
        * Experience Making Sense of Data: You can manipulate and analyze datasets. You might have a degree in a quantitative field or relevant work experience. Just to give you an idea of our backgrounds, many of us have done work in economics, physics, business, and sociology. While machine learning techniques are useful for many kinds of problems, this role doesn't require them often.
        BONUS POINTS
        * Knowledge of Excel, SQL, R (or similar stats packages)
        * Experience with A/B Testing and experimental design
