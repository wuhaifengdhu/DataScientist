            Enterprise Select has partnered with a revolutionary Biotech company in the Bay Area to help build out their cutting-edge Data Science team. Their data science group is not like those at other companies. They generate and process massive amounts of sequencing data on a system designed and built in-house from the ground up.
            As a Data Scientist, you will be performing analysis to drive development of our sequencing technology. The successful candidate must be excited about learning new concepts from chemistry, physics, algorithm development and electrical engineering and applying them to an interdisciplinary project. Most your time will be spent aggregating, analyzing and summarizing the output of DNA sequencing experiments. You will also be responsible for updating, maintaining and testing portions of our automated analysis pipeline.
             WHAT YOUâ€™LL DO:
              Using command line tools to perform data conversion and analysis
              Supporting other team members in retrieving and archiving experimental results
              Quickly writing scripts to automate routine analysis tasks
              Creating insightful, simple graphics to represent complex trends
             WHAT TO BRING:
              MUST have scientific programming experience (Matlab, R, Python, etc.); familiarity with numpy and the Python scientific stack is a strong plus
              Demonstrated ability to track and work with 100s-1000s of files and GB-TB of data
              Need to be comfortable working in a Unix environment,
              Basic understanding of analog electronic circuits is a plus
              Chemistry or biophysics background is a plus
             IDEAL BACKGROUND:
              BS or MS in computer science, physics, electrical engineering or similar
              Experience working on a long-term, lab-based project (academic experience acceptable)
             NEXT STEPS:
