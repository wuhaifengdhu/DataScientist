        About Freebird:
Freebird empowers travelers to instantly and seamlessly get back on their way when life throws a wrench into their travel plans. Combining technology, data science, and a fresh take on travel UX, we’re tackling the age-old problem of flight delays and cancellations. With Freebird, travelers have the ability to rebook their disrupted flight in less than 30 seconds -- at no additional cost. Our product immediately notifies customers of travel issues on their itineraries, helps them find the best alternative flight/route in real time, and gives them the ability to instantly book a new ticket -- for free -- in just 3 taps.
We launched in August 2015 and raised $3.5MM in seed funding from General Catalyst, Accomplice, and Slow Ventures in November 2015.
About the Role:
   • You’ll be applying advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to create scalable solutions for fun & well-defined problems. We have incredible data on flight histories, airport slowdowns, mechanical trouble, weather, and everything else you could imagine that causes flight hassles.
   • You’ll work closely with the engineering team to create and deploy your models efficiently.
   • You’ll get to design experiments to answer targeted questions on every aspect of Freebird’s operations.
Sound like you?
   • You have experience managing end-to-end machine learning pipelines: you’ll be working with GB- to TB-sized datasets, and take charge from data exploration and model building to performance evaluation and optimization.
   • You’ve mastered one of Python, R, Scala (the Berkeley stack), or Java, but broader experience is always a plus.
   • You’re familiar with standard software development practices (unit testing, agile, continuous deployment) and have experience working in a production environment.
About Our Culture:
We’re a small team of product, technology, and travel enthusiasts that are passionate about building a delightful customer experience. We believe that empowering customers starts with empowering employees, and share common values of trust, transparency, empathy. If you’re an ambitious, smart, natural collaborator who likes learning new technologies and is interested in working with a small, core team, we’d love to talk to you about joining Freebird.
