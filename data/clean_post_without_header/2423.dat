This approach enables the development of industry focused products, industry research and client specific solutions within a scalable environment decreasing time to market. Supporting the new platform is a robust data governance and data management methodology, incorporating best practices in anonymization and entity level management.
           Our product development team focuses on combining benchmarking, segmentation, predictive models and recommender systems to create scalable, repeatable products that allow clients to leverage our analytic capabilities.
