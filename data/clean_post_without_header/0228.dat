          At Nuna, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare affordable for everyone. We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation’s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.
          Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.
          Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies, health plans, and self-insured employers, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.
            Nuna Engineering
          At Nuna Engineering, we build so that everyone can use, learn, and act. Our technology enables data scientists, analysts, benefits officers, and policymakers to understand healthcare data while ensuring its integrity, security and privacy. Our work runs the gamut, from joining multiple streams of messy real-world data to building queryable data warehouses to constructing visualizations and dashboards that provide actionable insight. We build systems that are auditable, as automated as possible, accurately represent the underlying data, and, perhaps most importantly, responsive to our end users' needs. We strive for a creative, collaborative engineering environment that implements best practices for peer review, readability, maintainability, and security of the code base and infrastructure.
           Government Services:
          The federal government team is responsible for expanding upon our existing work with federally funded healthcare programs (like Medicare, Medicaid, Veteran’s Administration, etc). This work is crucial to our mission of making healthcare more accessible and valuable to all people. The team works with detailed data at a massive scale to enable analysis and insights to be derived from processing.
          The Nuna product engineering team is a diverse organization of data processing engineers, web engineers, and front end engineers. The product is both an analysis pipeline and the integrations and tools that allow for many different users to have meaningful access and derive insights from the data that we have processed and made available.
           Commercial:
          The commercial team is responsible for expanding upon our existing work with commercial self-insured entities. These entities (large employers, etc) need to understand how the benefits they are providing to their constituents are actually being used, whether those people are getting quality care or not, and whether programs put into place are having the desired effect. The team works with data from many different sources, processes it, and provides tools for our data scientists.
          The Nuna product engineering team is a diverse organization of engineers who are concerned about the different layers that make up our stack: ingestion tools, pipeline orchestration, data storage, and web front ends. The product is both an analysis pipeline and the integrations and tools that allow for many different users to have meaningful access and derive insights from the data that we have processed and made available.
