        The Oracle Data Cloud isan industry leader in connecting online and offline data to execute and measurethe effectiveness of marketing initiatives. To enable these insights, theODC relies on the power of the Oracle Identity Graph to connect thousands ofdisparate data sources to create comprehensive and accurate anonymized profilesacross the numerous ID spaces where marketers are trying to reachconsumers. These ID spaces include, butare not limited to, email, mobile phones, tablets, computers, TVs and postaladdress. Creating these anonymized profiles in a privacy safe and accuratemanner is foundational to building targeting audiences at scale as well asdetecting a clear signal when measuring the effectiveness of any campaign.
        The ODC ID Graph is madepossible because of a lot of data and a lot of data science. As a Senior Data Scientist, within theIdentity Data Science (iDS) Research & Development team, you'll be involvedin developing a best-in-class ID Graph that fuels the ODC. You will aide indeep exploratory data analysis to understand the quality of ID Graph data aswell as develop new machine learning algorithms to connect the data andevaluate accuracy of the links. Whileall projects start as proof of concepts, ultimately, you will also work withengineers to implement your solutions into production. You will be asked to collaboratewith engineers, researchers, product leads and business development to deeplyunderstand the data in the ecosystem, how it is collected, and the power of thedata to inform the ID Graph and ODC Data Science products. Also, you will help educate the broaderbusiness on how to think about and interact with the ID Graph for theirapplications.
        Primary responsibilitiesas an individual contributor include:
        * Writing prototype codein Python, Scala, Hive, and Spark to understand and improve our understandingof the ID Graph as a whole
        * Researching andimplementing hybrid probabilistic-graph algorithms on massive amounts of data
        * Independentlyoptimizing and tweaking code and the cloud environment
        * Identifyingopportunities for improvement in data cleansing, manipulating, and processingwithin existing software applications and frameworks
        * Understanding thebusiness asks and requirements for the Identity Graph then providethought-leadership in the implementation of analytical solutions
        * Collaborating withother team members and data scientists to brainstorm solutions
        * Collaborating withengineers to build scaled and supported ID Graph products
        * Communicatingeffectively across teams to explain the solutions put in place and theimplications on the business
