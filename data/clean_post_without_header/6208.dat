        Monsanto's Emerging Leaders in Science (ELS) scientific leadership recruitment and career development program is seeking top scientific talent to join our Technology Organization (R&D). If you are successful in being selected into this program, you will be immersed in a comprehensive, cross-functional rotational experience within a company that is a globally recognized innovation leader in plant breeding, biotechnology, crop protection, biologicals and precision agriculture. As a participant in this program, you will be quickly involved in multiple areas across Monsanto's Technology Organization, and you will work with, and be mentored by Monsanto's most talented scientific leaders. You will emerge prepared to lead efforts focused on agricultural innovation.
        Monsanto is looking for the next generation of leaders in the field of data science. We are seeking a highly motivated individual to join the cutting edge Emerging Leaders in Science Program (ELS). The successful candidate will have a demonstrated track record of competitive accomplishments. As part of the ELS program, you will be expected to foster and advance cross technology efforts to meet scientific challenges that address Monsanto's commitment to global agriculture. The position is for an integral member of a multidisciplinary, results-driven, customer focused growing automation team. The position represents a full-time, career opportunity in an exciting, dynamic environment serving a broad range of research and development needs of a Life Sciences Company. The person filling this position must have highly effective verbal and written communication skills, the ability to work collaboratively with diverse stakeholders, the agility to respond rapidly to challenges as they arise and possess clear potential for rapid growth and learning.
        The world population is expected to exceed nine billion by 2050. One of this century's major scientific challenges is to feed that growing population sustainably, affordably and with minimal impact on the environment. The next major advances in agriculture will require integrating information from Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Agronomy, Weather and Breeding. Monsanto is committed to solving these challenges. You will apply rigorous analytical methods to test assumptions and find hidden insights among rich, diverse, heterogeneous data sets. These data sets include environmental and yield data from millions of crop acres, genomic data from hundreds of thousands of hybrid plant crosses and metagenomic samples teeming with microbial diversity.
        Turning these inventions into tangible benefits for society requires more than scientific expertise. It also requires leadership: the foresight to identify strategic gaps and challenges, the ability to influence others to work toward a shared vision, and a gift for clarity in communication. An ideal candidate will have demonstrated these leadership traits. For the individuals having these unique skills Monsanto will provide specific, tailored training to foster your further growth and development.
