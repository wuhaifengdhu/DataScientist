        McKinsey Solutions offers practical, intuitive tools that help people at all levels of an organization generate insights they need to address both strategic and day-to-day decisions. These solutions complement McKinsey's traditional client service and are delivered in many ways, including subscriptions, workshops, training programs and project-based engagements. You will work closely with clients to embed our tools, analytics and expertise, and provide on-going support to help them build the capabilities they need to revolutionize how decisions are made.
        McKinsey Solutions is a core part of New Ventures, which is a recently formed and fast-growing part of McKinsey, focused on fostering innovations driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile, social and other technologies and integrating them into our client work. It is a foundation for – and expands our investment in – our entrepreneurial culture.
        What You'll Do
        You will oversee all activities related to the development and delivery of the Solution services to clients and work closely with the Solution Board to advance the strategic aims of the Solution.
        You'll be in a pivotal role that is responsible for building one of our Solutions, managing its team, P&L and client relationships globally. To do all these things effectively will require a drive and passion for analytical content with the managerial capacity to deliver services with real client impact.
        As a Solution Leader you will also provide leadership and management to your Solution team and drive their effectiveness by designing and developing an operational strategy to enable automation, scalability and expansion across geographies, industries and functions. You will educate and evangelize about Solution offerings principally through consulting teams in order to increase demand, grow the business and, over time, take on responsibility for direct client development. You will define the road map from inception to launch/delivery of new product offerings as well as define and drive product positioning and value proposition. Additionally, you will work with Practice leaders to understand the market demands of each Practice to ensure that the product direction and strategy meet global needs.
