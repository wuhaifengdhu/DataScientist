        Who You'll Work With
        You will be working in either Waltham, MA or New York with our growing Banking Advanced Analytics at McKinsey (BAAM) offering.
        This is an entrepreneurial team which today comprises elite data scientists, developers, and domain experts conducting big data analytics for financial clients using leading edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and cloud based computing. We are looking for experienced data scientists within financial services, who want to work on the hardest and most interesting AI and data science problems within banking and asset management.
        BAAM is part of McKinsey New Ventures which fosters innovation driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile and social by developing new products/services and integrating them into our client work. It is helping to shift our model toward asset-based consulting and is a foundation for –and expands our investment in –our entrepreneurial culture. Through innovative software as a service solutions, strategic acquisitions, and a vibrant ecosystem of alliances, we are redefining what it means to work with McKinsey.
        As one of the fastest-growing parts of our firm, New Ventures has more than 1,000 dedicated professionals (including more than 800 analysts and data scientists) and we're hiring more mathematicians, data scientists, designers, software engineers, product managers, client development managers and general managers.
        McKinsey helps a broad range of banking and finance firms navigate a dynamically changing environment, in which regulatory constraints, consumer de-leveraging and evolving channel dynamics present significant obstacles to profitability. Our approach to supporting clients is customized and collaborative, and combines deep industry expertise and experience with proprietary quantitative analytics and research. We help clients build the capabilities they need to succeed in the long term.
        What You'll Do
        You will analyze and evaluate large quantities of data in relational databases and unstructured forms of data, effectively balancing quality, availability, timeliness, and cost factors.
        Leveraging your advanced data analysis skills, you will create innovative approaches to answer our clients' most relevant questions. You will apply a data-driven analytical approach to an enormous variety of problems in banking practices such as a world-leading bank figuring out how to best do its customer care across all of its channels or an M&A project which needs to find most effective way to combine two credit card portfolios and expand customer bases.
        Your work will be project-oriented. You will often be responsible for the entire analytical process – from outlining the type of solution through implementation, interpretation of results and transferring capabilities to the client or colleagues. You will constructively discuss your findings in dialog with consultants and clients while always looking for the best solution. Some work at the client site is expected. Working on projects and exchanging experiences with your colleagues means you will face new intellectual challenges on a daily basis, while continuously building your methodological knowledge and skills.
