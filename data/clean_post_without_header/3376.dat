        The role:
        It is an exciting time to join the data science team at Sojern: business is booming, the engineering platform is nimble and rock-solid, and there is still plenty of low-hanging fruit pick regarding data products. Each of our data scientists owns their own high-impact initiatives--whether it is a new modeling technique delivering better predictions, a new analysis and visualization highlighting weak spots in our pipelines, or a new tool that can help the team's workflow. We're looking for scientists who can identify a problem, develop a plan of attack, and come up with a practical solution.
        Your day-to-day:
        * Developing new algorithmic approaches -- Our algorithms are at the core of our advertising business and small improvements can have big impact. We're always looking to improve both performance and efficiency.
        * Shining light into our data -- Sojern's traveler profiles contain glimpses into the human decision-making process regarding travel. The scope is immense, and the potential questions endless. We need talented people to help explore the data, identify the important patterns, and communicate these insights to the team.
        * Tool development -- We can only do the above two items effectively if we aren't constantly re-implementing simple tasks.
        Requirements:
        * Python proficiency -- It's our lingua franca, and we're big Jupyter fans
        * PhD in a STEM field -- Training in analytics and experimentation is key
        * Machine Learning experience -- Successful implementation of ML solutions
        * Communication Ability -- We need to discuss/present abstract concepts
        Perks:
        At Sojern, culture is king. We keep the stress low, the dress casual, and the work interesting. No one is counting your vacation days, we trust (and encourage!) our employees to take the time they need. We regularly eat out as a team, provide the hardware you'll need, and otherwise let you dig in!
