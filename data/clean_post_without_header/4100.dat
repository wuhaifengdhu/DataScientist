        Do you crave volumes of data and the tools and resources to analyze it? Do you delight at the prospect of discovering patterns and transforming data into actionable information? Do you love working collaboratively with intelligent, energetic, no-nonsense colleagues? Are you as nice as you are brilliant? If you've answered "yes" to all four questions, we'd like to introduce ourselves.
        What You'll Do
        At the core of LiveRamp's products is a massive graph that connects the different identifiers for each person, their online devices, and the identifiers that 100s of different marketing platforms use to recognize them. As a LiveRamp Data Scientist you'll analyze the complex connections in this half a trillion node graph that contains PBs of data from over a 1000 different sources. To work with this massive dataset, you'll learn cutting edge big data analysis tools (e.g., Redshift and Pregel). Using the results of your investigations, you'll further develop our conceptual framework for understanding LiveRamp's identity graph, including new terminology, metrics, mathematical models, visualizations, and reports. Further, you'll apply this conceptual framework to create new data refinement strategies that filter out suspect connections to further enhance the quality of LiveRamp's identity graph.
        Types of projects you'll work on:
        * Further develop our conceptual framework for understanding and making quantitative decisions about our complex and massive identity graph.
        * Including the development of new terminology, metrics, mathematical models, visualizations, and reports.
        * Of paramount importance is understanding identity accuracy (i.e., correctness) and reach (i.e., completeness, how many people can we match?).
        * Apply this conceptual framework in the development of data refinement strategies that enhance the accuracy of our identity graph.
        * Explore and quantify the reach and accuracy implications for incorporating new sources of identity data into the graph.
        * Quantify the "holes" in our identity graph. I.e., what types of consumers are we missing identity data for?
        What You'll Need to Have
        * 2+ years Data Science experience or a graduate degree (PhD or thesis-based Masters) in a quantitative field.
        * Strong grasp of statistics and data mining techniques.
        * Solid experience with Python, R or other statistical toolsets (we use Python).
        * Strong technical communication, both written and verbal.
        * Type S(tartup) personality: smart, ethical, friendly, hard-working and proactive (no exceptions).
        * Desire to work in San Francisco. We will relocate you if necessary.

        * Stock
        * Awesome co-workers
        * Unlimited paid time off
        * A dog friendly office
        * Catered meals & stocked kitchen
        * 401K Matching
