        The Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in Boulder, Colorado and the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) have an immediate opening for a research associate with experience in mesoscale data assimilation and/or numerical weather prediction. The scientist will have an appointment within the Assimilation Development Branch (ADB) of the ESRL Global Systems Division.
        The scientist will develop and test modifications in data assimilation for mesoscale models and provide community support for data assimilation. The scientist will work in collaboration with other scientists in ESRL/GSD/ADB and also with the DTC and other groups within ESRL, NCAR, NCEP and other collaborators through NOAA. This work will include development for the HRRR and Rapid Refresh (RAP) assimilation systems using the GSI (Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation) assimilation and the WRF (Weather Research and Forecast) model. It will also involve work with NOAA's Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS) applications toward short-range forecast and nowcasting applications. A significant part of the responsibilities will also to provide user support for community data assimilation systems in the Developmental Testbed Center. The scientist will work as part of team in testing and refining algorithms for real-time operational application. The position is located in Boulder, Colorado. Salary will be commensurate with experience.
