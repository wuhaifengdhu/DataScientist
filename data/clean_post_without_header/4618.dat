             Duties & Responsibilities
            The Ölveczky group
            , a Neuroscience lab in the
             Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology
            and the Center for Brain Science at
             Harvard University
            ,  is hiring a Scientific Programmer to build and maintain a computational infrastructure for acquiring, analyzing, and storing large neuroscience-related datasets. You will be an integral member of a collegial research team focused on solving intriguing mysteries of the brain through cutting-edge research. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in scientific programming using one of the following (C/C++, C#, F#, or Fortran), and have experience with python and interacting with databases.
            Our research focuses on:
              Uncovering the neural mechanisms that allow us to learn and execute motor skills. We use rodents as a model system and train our experimental subjects on various motor tasks, while measuring and manipulating activity in the underlying neural circuits.
              We develop automated and high-throughput methods for recording and manipulating nervous system activity. In particular we have pioneered a system for continuous and long-term recording of large neuronal populations in behaving animals.
              We are also developing new data analysis approaches to extract information from the large data sets we acquire, and to identify principles of how the brain works.
            This position will work within Harvard’s Research Computing
             http://rc.fas.harvard.edu
            team and the Ölveczky research team to build and maintain a computational infrastructure capable of supporting our research.  Duties will include:
              working with researchers to update and improve existing data acquisition and data analysis software, written in C# F# respectively, and port this software infrastructure to a more flexible code base like python. The goal is to create a user-friendly platform for recording and analyzing large behavioral and neural datasets.
              develop new analytical methods for large-scale data analysis, and their efficient software implementation.
              managing and optimizing large-scale multi petabyte data storage solutions.
              writing rest api to interact with databases for scientific use
             Basic Qualifications
            Master’s Degree in computational based science and at least 3 years of experience in a research environment OR PhD.
            Demonstrated experience in software engineering with emphasis on scientific programming, database management and/or data science.
             Additional Qualifications
            Experience with C#, F#, C/C++, Python, and Matlab desired. Rest API for database interaction (flask or sqlalchemy). The group works extensively with Python libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Rdkit, and iPython/Jupyter. Front-end web development python/javascript is a plus (e.g. react, ember, angular, etc). DevOps experience with puppet and containers will be an advantage, as will experience with large scale file system and data management techniques. Research computing will collaborate extensively on operations of storage and databases.
             Additional Information
            This is a 3-year term appointment from date of hire with the possibility of renewal.
            When applying for this position, please submit your resume and cover letter in our preferred format as one combined document (resume followed by cover letter).
            All formal written offers will be made by FAS HR.
            Please note we are unable to provide visa sponsorship.
