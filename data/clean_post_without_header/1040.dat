        At Socrata, we believe that data when made transparently accessible can illuminate, inform and inspire. Socrata builds cloud-based software products that democratize access to public sector data and put it into people's hands so they can use it at work, at home and on the go. Over time we'll broaden our market position to other data rich industries, in addition to the public sector.
        How safe is my neighborhood? Where should I catch the next bus? Which healthcare plan should I choose for my family? Answers to quality of life questions such as these are buried in troves of government data. Too often, this data is inaccessible and only useful if you're a database administrator, or a data scientist. We're out to change that.
        We serve some of the leading government and multi-lateral organizations globally including: the US Federal Government and many federal agencies; a number of states including Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and New York; most major US cities including New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and Boston; several foreign governments; and the most recognizable and prestigious non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including the World Bank, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Nations.
