          At Enigma we are passionate about the transformative potential of data and are creating the next generation of tools to unlock this potential. Data science at Enigma covers an exciting diversity of topics and applications, from developing products with engineering teams, to data exploration for client consultations, to collaborating with public agencies to save lives. As a Senior Data Scientist with the Analytics group your contributions will reach the whole company. You will guide analytical projects from conception to completion with quantitative rigor and acuity. And you will not only work with our next-generation technology, you'll help shape this technology to solve real-world data challenges.
          The ideal person will enhance our team by combining analytical skills and business sense to develop data-driven products. This hybrid of data science and product development requires a talent for communicating and connecting with technical and non-technical collaborators alike. Ideally, you will have experience bringing data products to market on a tight timeline, where “market” might include commercial settings, open source contributions, or collaborative research. We value data scientists who can quickly implement elegant solutions to complex problems. While you are excited by cutting-edge methods, your fascination with these technologies does not distract you from straightforward solutions. Not least, you should share our enthusiasm for using public data to support better decisions at all levels of government and enterprise.
           What we look for:
           PhD or equivalent experience in a data-intensive discipline
           Ideally 2 years of professional or volunteer experience
           Self-starting leadership experience and entrepreneurial initiative
           Strong statistical skills and familiarity with machine learning techniques, and the ability to clearly convey complex concepts with plain language
           Demonstrated ability to produce high-quality, product-focused, scalable analysis on tight timelines
           Fluency with analytical programming, including libraries for cleaning, reshaping, exploring and visualizing data; 2 years experience with R or Python preferred
           Creative and versatile problem-solving skills
           Familiarity with contemporary business practices such as lean product development
           Attention-to-detail balanced with ability to prioritize
           Experience with any of the following is desirable: entity resolution, natural language processing, information retrieval, graph databases, streaming analytics
           Our Story:
          Founded in 2011, Enigma grew out of an effort to retrieve, normalize, and host public data.Fun fact, our big coming out party was winning TechCrunch Disrupt's 2013 Battlefield.
          Our vision is to empower people to interpret, and improve, the world around them. We place data in the context of the real world and make it connected, open and actionable. Enigma has one of the world’s largest repositories of public data and a powerful infrastructure for operationalizing data in the enterprise. We help global-scale companies tackle some of their hardest problems by driving public data and enterprise ontologies in mission-critical workflows.
          Along the way, we have accumulated expertise from centralizing and connecting billions of public records and built powerful enterprise infrastructure for data ingestion, exploration, linking, and delivery (all of which is used internally).
          Enigma is a rapidly growing team based in the Flatiron neighborhood of New York City. We are Series B funded startup backed by an amazing roster of investors including NEA Ventures, Two Sigma Ventures, American Express Ventures, and The New York Times Company.
