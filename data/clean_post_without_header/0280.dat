        Today, there were over 500 million Tweets, over 85% of U.S. Consumers used their mobile device while watching TV, and within the next four years, women will control $28 Trillion in annual consumer spending. At Nielsen, you will help analyze and understand what all this means to our consumers, and how it truly influences and drives consumer behavior in what people watch and what people buy. Nielsen is the science behind what's next for our clients.
        To explore What People Watch, Nielsen measures digital video viewing, such as the latest television shows streamed through a laptop or viral YouTube clips viewed on smartphones. In order to determine the audience demographics behind YouTube content, Nielsen partners closely with YouTube by combining their immense but incomplete big data with small, high quality data from Nielsen's desktop, smartphone, and tablet panels. With these two rich data sources, there is plenty of analysis to be done. As an intern, you will get the chance to explore both datasets, brainstorm on the latest and most innovative research methodologies (eg. statistical distributions or machine learning algorithms), design a model, and recommend whether it is appropriate to implement your model into final reporting to share with clients.
