        1010data travels at the speed of thought to make Big Data discovery easy; we power sub-second responses to analyses run on billions of rows of data.
        An essential tool to more than 750 of the world's top retail, distribution, manufacturing, telecom, government and financial services enterprises including The New York Stock Exchange, Dollar General, RiteAid, and Sysco; 1010data is a highly differentiated product that is becoming the industry standard for Big Data Discovery and Data Sharing.
        1010data is seeking talented UX Developers with advanced web design and development skills to evolve our high functioning, client facing, core product platform technology. Expertise using common web development frameworks (HTML/Javascript, Ruby on Rails) is required. Substantial experience building applications using BI/Visualization development platforms (e.g. Looker, Logi Analytics, IBI WebFocus) is also welcomed.
        This position will be laser-focused on creating beautiful and intuitive user experiences for the distinct user types of the 1010data platform.
        UX Developers must empathize with a wide range of platform user personas; you will work closely with Product Managers to personalize the 1010data interface for each of these user types. On any given day, you may need to put yourself in the shoes of an IT Administrator at a major US retailer, a business user at an international telecom giant, or a data scientist at one of the world's biggest banks. Your design decisions will shape the way that all of 1010data's clients use the platform.
        This is a front-end motivated role, but will require some knowledge of 1010data's back-end services. You will have to be able to think on both sides of the connection. Experience using a query language such as SQL is required. Experience with Vector programming, including any of the following: K, APL, Erlang, Haskell, J, Lisp, Scheme, Ocaml, Q, Scala would be a major plus.
        With more than 25 trillion rows of data in our private cloud, 1010data is designed to scale to the largest volumes of granular data, the most disparate and varied data sets, and the most complex advanced analytics. All while delivering lightning-quick system performance.
        If you are an enthusiastic front-end developer and are confident embracing new technologies to make a tangible impact, come evolve our product as we continue to change the rules of big data discovery.
