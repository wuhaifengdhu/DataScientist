        Data Scientist
        About the Company
        DigitalGlobe is the world's leading provider of high-resolution Earth imagery, data and analysis. With the most sophisticated commercial satellite constellation in orbit, we create the world's smartest images, to give customers confidence when making critical decisions. Unmatched imagery quality, global coverage, and actionable analytics make us a trusted partner worldwide. The Geospatial Big Data Platform (GBDX) team is working to take our entire 16-plus year archive of satellite imagery and put it in the cloud for real-time and scalable discovery, access and compute. Hundreds of developers are building new applications and machine learning algorithms on GBDX and in our recently expanded Services business. This new ecosystem is where data science meets computer vision, image mining and geospatial analysis in order to answer questions at a global scale.
        About the team
        The Data Science Applications team designs and implements image processing, feature extraction and machine learning algorithms on GBDX, in order to address customer use cases and to push the boundaries of what is achievable on GBDX. With petabytes of satellite imagery sourced from the world's leading constellation, we are in no lack of pixels. Making sense of these pixels is the real challenge: from mapping damaged buildings during natural disasters, detecting remote settlements so that humanitarian aid can be distributed, to tracking infrastructure changes in large cities, we continuously look for innovative ways to derive actionable insight on our changing world from our imagery.
