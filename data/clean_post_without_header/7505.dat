        Data Scientists organize and interpret Big Data to inform US decision makers, drive successful operations and shape CIA technology and resource investments. Data Scientists work with advanced hardware, software, and techniques to develop computational algorithms and statistical methods that find patterns and relationships in large volumes of data. They clearly communicate their conclusions to a lay audience and become experts through Agency-sponsored continuing education, attendance at academic and technical conferences, and collaboration with the Intelligence Community.
        Through CIA's global mission, the Agency has access to unique data sets that can be analyzed in one computational environment. Successful applicants will have keen technical insight, creativity, initiative, and a curious mind.
