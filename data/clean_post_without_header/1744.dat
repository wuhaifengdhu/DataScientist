        The Data Scientist family is accountable for using data to make decisions, which includes building predictive models and developing new machine learning techniques that enable our client to make better decisions to achieve its goals. The Data Scientist Family requires Analytic Agility, the ability to quickly learn new modeling/machine learning techniques, programming languages, and see how these ideas can integrate to optimize the business.
        This role is responsible for leading the use of data to make decisions. This includes the development and management of new machine learning predictive modeling algorithms; the coding development of tools that use machine learning/predictive modeling to make business decisions; searching for and integrating new data (both internal and external) that improves our modeling and machine learning results (and ultimately our decisions); and discovery of solutions to business problems that can be solved through the use of machine learning/predictive modeling. This role will also begin to manage projects of medium to high complexity.
        * Uses best practices to develop statistical, machine learning techniques to build models on telematics data that would handle a wide range of problems ranging from probabilistic inference on phone trajectories, data fusion between noisy sensors, and classification of driving behavior.
        * Work on data analysis and predictive modeling of sensor data collected from the car and mobile phones (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.)
        * Identify KPI's generated from telematics sensor data.
        * Manages data and data requests to improve the accuracy of our data and decisions made from data analysis.
        * Uses and learns a wide variety of tools and languages to achieve results (e.g., R, Python, Hadoop).
        * Identifies languages and tools that can bring efficiencies or needed techniques to the team.
        * Works on data and business problems to drive improved business results through designing, building, and partnering to implement models.
        * Collaborates the with team in order to improve the effectiveness of business decisions through the use of data and machine learning/predictive modeling.
        * Understands the business' problems to identify the optimal modeling approach.
        * Communicates to team members, leadership and stakeholders on findings to ensure models are well understood and incorporated into business processes.
        * Utilizes effective project planning techniques to break down moderately complex projects into tasks and ensure deadlines are kept.
        * Works with leaders to ensure the project will meet their needs.
        * The development and execution of a communication strategy, with appropriate coaching, that keeps all relevant stakeholders informed and provides an opportunity to influence the direction of the work.
        Job Qualifications
        Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, mathematics, computer science, finance.
        * Master's or PhD preferred in a quantitative field such as statistics, mathematics, computer science, finance, or economics.
        * Experience in using statistical modeling and/or machine learning techniques to build models on telematics / sensor data to drive company's business results.
        * Strong understanding of telematics and mobile phone sensors.
        * Experience in managing and manipulating large, complex datasets.
        * Experience in working with statistical software such as SAS, SPSS, MatLab, R, CART, etc.
        * Understanding of the Insurance market place; economics and regulation preferred.
        * Ability to code and develop prototypes in languages such as Python, Perl, Java, C.
        * Knowledge of advanced modeling technique.
        * Ability to analyze and interpret moderate to complex concepts.
        * Ability to provide written and oral interpretation of highly specialized terms and data, and ability to present this data to others with different levels of expertise.
        * Demonstrated analytic agility.
        All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply by submitting their resume as an MS word document including a cover letter with a summary of relevant qualifications, highlighting clearly any special or relevant experience.
