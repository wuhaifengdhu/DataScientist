        Data Miner
        The Data Miner is a specialist in the analysis, manipulation, and presentation of complex data to answer specific business questions. They typically have a strong statistical background, and may be a statistician by training. However, their work includes the entire process of data analysis, including the data cleansing, data preparation and visualization of results. Data Miners are extremely detail-oriented and focused, but are able to understand the context in which their analysis will eventually fit, and use that to guide their work. The Data Miner is comfortable working with very large and often â€œmessyâ€? data sets and enjoy the process of bringing order out of chaos.
