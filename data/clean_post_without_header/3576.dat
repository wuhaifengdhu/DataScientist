           Principal Data Science Engineer
           Job Type:
          Full-Time
          Location:
         San Francisco, CA
          Department:
         Engineering
          At
           OpenTable
          , we take pleasure in Software Design. We believe that velocity comes from a commitment to clean code and solid engineering principles. We deliver innovative products through rapid, continuous development. We are passionate about building small, independent product development teams – product managers, designers and engineers working together empowered to make their own decisions.
         OpenTable is looking for an experienced, impact-driven Software Engineer to join our team.   In this role you will work closely with our product management, user experience, and engineering teams to build a next-generation recommendation platform that help Diners make confident decisions about their next meal out. Your role will be part architect and part systems builder, responsible for building a reliable, performant recommendation system that can be quickly modified as new product requirements come in, and will scale to tens of millions of users.
          About you:
         You want to fuse your interest in how people make decisions, with building well-designed software.  You care deeply about providing value to customers through product-driven features, performance, uptime, and elegant systems design.  You are excited about the problems of local search, recommendations, and analyzing large amounts of heterogenous data to build indexes and models for fast query response times.  You care about the details and you like to understand the systems you build fully, even if that means popping open a 3rd party library or reading through services you aren’t directly responsible for.
          Responsibilities:
            Design, architect, implement, and debug robust, high-volume production recommendation systems
            Implement and integrate data ingestion, ETL, analysis and data-mining systems
            Implement monitoring and introspection tools
            Keep this mission-critical system up with high availability
         Requirements:
            BS/MS in CS or solid understanding of computer science and software development from work experience
            Extensive programming experience (8-10+ years, though not necessarily professionally)
            Strong competencies in platform/backend service technologies, data structures, software design, and profiling
            Experience with databases (PostgreSQL in particular), Information Retrieval technologies (Lucene & Elastic Search in particular), and cloud computing tool chains
            Expert knowledge developing, debugging, profiling, and load-testing Java services
         Bonus points if you have
            Experience with "big-data" frameworks such as Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Scalding, and Spark
            Experience with Machine Learning approaches.
