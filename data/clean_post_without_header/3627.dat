        Department Overview: Data Science Apps (DSA)

The Data Science Apps team is a family of multi-talented technologists with backgrounds ranging from Artificial Intelligence to Finance. What connects us all is a shared curiosity for how to drive product strategy with data, a passion for getting the job done, and a healthy disregard for constraints.
        Who You Are:
        * You know your stuff, we don't care how you learned it.
        * You are an expert (10+ years) in statistics or machine learning (and your friends glaze over because you can't stop talking about them over dinner)
        * You have 7+ years experience in writing scalable code. R, Python and Spark are our favorite languages but not your top ones? We can teach you.

        * You know how to communicate insights with graphs and pictures
        * Understand why simplicity is important and good enough is not a cop out
        * Innovative, you find that unique viewpoint to solve problems that make others run and cower
