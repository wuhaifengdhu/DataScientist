        ANTICIPATED AWARD DATE: February/March 2017
        ANTICIPATED START DATE: March/April 2017
        SCOPE OF WORK
        The largest agency directorate and supporter of GEOINT Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) is the Analysis Directorate. This directorate assists in providing timely, relevant, accurate GEOINT analysis, data, and services to customers in support of the national security. The Analysis Directorate does so by producing products and technical support that serves the constantly growing national and international demand for imagery and geospatial applications—mapping, navigation, environmental monitoring, urban planning, resource management, homeland defense, national security, and emergency preparedness.
        The second largest agency directorate and user of GEOINT FTEs is the Source Operations and Management Directorate. The Source Directorate provides the ability to register and adjudicate GEOINT users needs, develop strategies to acquire or produce all GEOINT sources, and manage/monitor the delivery of all GEOINT sources to those creating actionable intelligence. This mission is accomplished through identifying existing source material in agency holdings or accessible from our GEOINT partners worldwide, gathering existing geospatial data and imagery from our US and foreign production partners, and creating products and data giving the select agency the ability to "Know the Earth ... Show the Way". The Source Directorate is responsible for national satellite imagery, commercial and airborne imagery and GEOINT foundation data--including elevation, feature, and gravity data. Source data is any resource that contributes to the creation of GEOINT and encompasses imagery, mapping, and any data describing the Earth's natural and manmade features, as well as activities that can be referenced.
