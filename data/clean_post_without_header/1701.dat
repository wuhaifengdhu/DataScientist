        Data Science incorporates techniques across many disciplines – including mathematics/statistics, computer programming, data engineering and ETL, software development, and high performance computing – with traditional business expertise with the goal of extracting meaning from data to optimize future business decisions. We are looking for individuals that have experience specifically working with geospatial data. Individuals in this field should be an expert/fluent in several of these disciplines and sufficiently proficient in others to effectively design, build, and deliver end to end predictive analytics products to optimize future decisions. Individual demonstrates sufficient analytic agility to quickly develop new skills across these disciplines as those disciplines evolve. This role is responsible for leading the use of data to make decisions. This includes the development and management of new machine learning predictive modeling algorithms; the codingdevelopment of tools that use machine learning/predictive modeling to make business decisions; searching for and integrating new data (both internal and external) that improves our modeling and machine learning results (and ultimately our decisions); and discovery of solutions to business problems that can be solved through the use of machine learning/predictive modeling.
        Key Responsibilities
        * Uses best practices to develop statistical, machine learning techniques to build models on geospatial data that would handle a wide range of problems.
        * Develop customized, spatial-related software solutions involving the use of GIS, remote sensing, numeric modeling, business intelligence and mathematical optimization techniques.
        * In a team setting, process, manipulate, and analyze geospatial data to extract knowledge or insights from large amounts of vector and raster data.
        * Candidates should draw from the fields of GIS, statistics, machine learning and/or predictive analytics. Analytic findings will be presented to internal customers in our Connected Car program
        * Provide fused intelligence bridging geospatial and intelligence analysis and continuity between strategic, operational, and tactical level planning.
        * Utilize ArcGIS and other geospatial tools to assist in visualizing and analyzing geospatial data.
        * Work on data analysis and predictive modeling of geospatial and sensor data collected from the car and mobile phones (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.)
        * Identify KPI's generated from geospatial data.
        * Manages data and data requests to improve the accuracy of our data and decisions made from data analysis.
        * Uses and learns a wide variety of tools and languages to achieve results (e.g., R, Python, Hadoop).
        * Identifies languages and tools that can bring efficiencies or needed techniques to the team.
        * Works on data and business problems to drive improved business results through designing, building, and partnering to implement models.
        * Collaborates with the team in order to improve the effectiveness of business decisions through the use of data and machine learning/predictive modeling.
        * Communicates to team members, leadership and stakeholders on findings to ensure models are well understood and incorporated into business processes.
        * Works with leaders to ensure the project will meet their needs.
        * The development and execution of a communication strategy, with appropriate coaching, that keeps all relevant stakeholders informed and provides an opportunity to influence the direction of the work.
        * Reviews and evaluates on appropriateness of techniques, given current modeling practices, to senior leadership.
        Qualifications
        * Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, mathematics, computer science, finance.
        * Experience in using statistical modeling and/or machine learning techniques to build models on geospatial data to drive company's business results.
        * Strong understanding of geospatial data
        * Advanced-level proficiency using ESRI ArcGIS software suite.
        * Experience in working with statistical software such as SAS, SPSS, MatLab, R, CART, etc.
        * Ability to code and develop prototypes in languages such as Python, Perl, Java, C.
        * Knowledge of advanced modeling techniques.
        * Ability to analyze and interpret moderate to complex concepts.
        * Ability to provide written and oral interpretation of highly specialized terms and data, and ability to present this data to others with different levels of expertise.
        * Demonstrated analytic agility.
        * Master's or PhD preferred in a quantitative field such as statistics, mathematics, computer science, finance, or economics.
        * Experience in managing and manipulating large, complex datasets.
        * Understanding of the Insurance market place; economics and regulation preferred.
        * Experience with navigation sensors such as GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer.
        All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply by submitting their resume as an MS word document including a cover letter with a summary of relevant qualifications, highlighting clearly any special or relevant experience.
