        Who are we?
        The Content Analytics team at Netflix has a clear mission - help the organization access & understand petabytes of data to make great decisions in the Content space. This encompasses everything from the moment we are thinking about licensing or creating an original show/movie, to understanding the impact once it's launched on our service. We get to tackle fascinating analytical questions: What's the best way to measure value delivered to a subscriber for a piece of content? What type of content should we invest in next? How can you measure the impact of content as it relates to subscriber retention?To tackle these questions, we work closely with content experts and data scientists to develop an enviable suite of metrics, exploratory analyses, tools & dashboards; all supported by robust data pipelines that scale with our continually expanding service (now in over 190 countries!).
