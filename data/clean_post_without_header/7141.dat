          Description
         As a member of Information Securityâ€™s Cyber Intelligence & Analysis team, you will be part of a team of analysts dedicated to increasing situational awareness of the operating environment, analyzing threats against it and determining potential impacts for the purpose of influencing decision-making and driving behavior change to reduce liability and risk to the business. These insights allow for the identification and prioritization risk and add immediate, demonstrable value to the business.
         This role is as exciting as it is challenging. The primary goal of our Data Scientist is to leverage data to support cyber intelligence throughout the strategic, operational and tactical spaces to identify current and emerging threats that when coupled with risk assessments provides increased fidelity into business risk. This goal necessitates an understanding of data science and familiarity with information security functional areas.
         You should have a background or knowledge of data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. A foundation in computer science, modeling, and statistics is desired. An understanding of data management, systems analysis, and system life-cycle phases are recommended. Knowledge business intelligence, data mining, inventory systems, log management systems, and social networks is desirable.
          Responsibilities:
           Provide expertise in data analytics and algorithm development supporting the integration and analysis of diverse data sources.
           Develop machine learning, data mining and statistical algorithms for pattern recognition and anomaly detection.
           Develop statistical and predictive analytic models for large, diverse data sets.
           Improve upon current methods for the automated processing and exploitation of large data sets.
           Design, develop and advance new methods to extract information from diverse data sources using flexible querying methods, innovative visualization, and data aggregation/integration, data mining and analytical techniques.
