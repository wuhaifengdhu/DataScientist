Our engineers develop complex, innovative, and highly scalable technology that is changing the face of digital media – devising new approaches, inventing new products, and opening up new markets. It’s a very exciting company in a very exciting industry. We’ve enjoyed massive growth since our founding in 2007, and we’re now a global company with offices in 20 locations – but this revolution has just begun!
          We are currently looking for a Data Scientist to support the ongoing development of MediaMath’s proprietary audience modeling platform. This individual will work closely with Product & Engineering teams on the conception, design, development, testing, and deployment of real-world applications of models & data that impact billions of dollars of marketing spend.
           Develop a solid understanding of MediaMath’s business context, key problems and issues of importance to the company, and the ways in which data-driven models and algorithms can help drive performance and provide insights.
           Develop a deep understanding of business data-sets through a combination of database queries, and exploratory statistical analysis and visualization.
           Rapidly develop a deep understanding of the quantitative methodologies and implementation details behind existing machine learning algorithms in place, and the currently-planned roadmap of enhancements.
           Formulate business needs as data science problems where applicable and effectively communicate these to peers, managers, and key stakeholders, including the benefits and limitations of models.
           Design and develop Machine Learning models and algorithms that drive performance and provide insights pertinent to audience development, from prototyping, to production deployment, to validation, across key areas of interest to the company
           Partner closely with Engineering on the architecture and implementation of modeling efforts to ensure performance and scalability
           Partner closely with Product on the incorporation of new modeling features into our product set
           Develop tools and processes to monitor performance of existing models and implement enhancements to improve scalability, reliability, and performance.
           Create supporting documentation for algorithms and models.
           Stay abreast of new developments in Machine Learning and Data Science, and investigate & develop new “challenger” approaches to compete against current “champions”
           Communicate effectively with other Data Scientists, with Product/Engineering, and with business stakeholders across the company to identify and define strategic data-intensive projects based on business needs.
