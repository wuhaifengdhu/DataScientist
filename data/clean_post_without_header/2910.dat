             Over twenty years ago, CarMax disrupted the automotive industry and to this day remains the undisputed market leader in a $500B industry. With best-in-class financial performance, customer satisfaction, and associate engagement, CarMax is well positioned for continued growth. With this growth, we strive to maintain our analytics-based competitive advantage through our algorithm driven pricing and inventory systems. To do so, we’re currently looking for experienced analytical modelers and data scientists who are looking to apply their passion for data and digital technology to drive business-critical decisions.
