          At Nuna, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare affordable for everyone. We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation’s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.
          Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.
          Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including self-insured companies and the United States government, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.

          Nuna Engineering
          At Nuna Engineering, we build so that everyone can use, learn, and act. Our technology enables data scientists, analysts, benefits officers, and policymakers to understand healthcare data while ensuring its integrity, security and privacy. Our work runs the gamut, from joining multiple streams of messy real-world data to building queryable data warehouses to constructing visualizations and dashboards that provide actionable insight. We build systems that are auditable, as automated as possible, accurately represent the underlying data, and, most importantly, responsive to our end users' needs. We strive for a creative, collaborative engineering environment that implements best practices of peer review, readability, maintainability, and security of the code base and infrastructure.
          The Nuna Analytics Platform team is Nuna’s small but rapidly growing frontend engineering team. We build Nuna’s user-facing web apps and the internal tools that enable our domain expert analysts to add rich features to those products on their own (and test them, too!). We work on top of Nuna’s Data Platform, turning a distributed SQL database into easy-to-use reporting tools, innovative data visualizations, and quickly digestible dashboards. We ensure enterprise-grade stability and startup-grade velocity by maintaining a well-tested code base and redeploying our infrastructure from scratch every release.
