        Data Scientist Manager - Trip Experiences
        Airbnb has become a global platform that connects travelers and hosts from over 34,000 cities. Our mission is to enable a world where anyone can belong anywhere, and providing a world class experience to our users is critical to our mission.
        Airbnb's mission goes beyond accommodation; in November 2016 we introduced new products that offer exciting options for travelers to further immerse in their destinations: Places offer the best "things to do", like restaurants and shops, curated by local experts, and Experiences offers unique "things to do" hosted by our community, like surfing classes and dinner parties. This is the one of the first building blocks in Airbnb's vision to build an end-to-end platform for authentic, local travel.
        We're seeking a proven data science leader excited about experimentation, analytics and mining user behavior to work on Airbnb's next big thing. You will lead a team focused on measuring, analyzing and mining actionable insights surrounding this new array of products. As a leader, you will set best practices, architect solutions, design processes and build a team that will grow at a fast clip. You'll partner with engineering and product leaders to design strategy and vision for this exciting new domain.
