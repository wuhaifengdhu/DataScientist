            The Business Intelligence Analyst role is described as part analyst, part artist. A data scientist is somebody who is inquisitive, who can stare at data and spot trends, really wants to learn and bring change to an organization.
           Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source – a CRM system, for example – a Business Intelligence Analyst will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. The Business Intelligence Analyst will sift through all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem. A Business Intelligence Analyst does not simply collect and report on data, but also looks at it from many angles, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data.
