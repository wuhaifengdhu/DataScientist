        The Data Science Intern will gain practical application of data science techniques in a corporate environment.
        Will be responsible for working with the Chief Economist to develop, implement and prototype analytical data-mining based business models, test and prototype various empirical techniques for the identification of complex correlated and causal relationships in large, complex data sets. This individual is responsible for the conduct of research studies (econometric, statistical and mathematical analysis of public record, mortgage, and real estate data). The individual will work with large data sets, data visualization, statistical and data-mining model development, real estate and housing finance data.
        Areas of specialized experience may include: applied mathematics or statistics, economics or forecasting.Example of the experience you will gain during the internship program is as follows:
        Modeling and Analysis
        * Create the necessary routines for extraction of modeling and analysis datasets
        * Development of prototype models
        o Eminence based "rule" models.
        o Supervised (logistic, decision and classification trees, random forests, etc.) learning models
        o Unsupervised (cluster algorithms, anomaly detection, local outliers etc.) learning models
        o In and out of sample testing and cross model comparison
        o Documentation of procedures, design, and results
        * Impact Analysis and Implementation
        o Sensitivity analysis
        o Mapping to "business scores"
        o Business process implementation based on algorithms- actionable alerts driven by scores
        o Business cost-benefit analysis- automation cost savings benefits compared to risk exposure
        o Documentation of procedures, design, and results
        Background/Experience Required for Candidacy:
        Experience with 'R' Studio or other related statistical/data mining software
