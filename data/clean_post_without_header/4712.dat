         Job Description
        Release Engineer/Tool-smith (OSRDR )
         Preferred Qualifications
         The Mission of Oracle Labs is straightforward: Identify, explore, and transfer new technologies that have the potential to substantially improve Oracle's business. The Information Retrieval and Machine Learning group (IRML) in Oracle Labs is working to develop, scale and deploy Machine Learning throughout all of Oracle's Products and Services.
         You will be part of a team within Oracle Labs whose role is to acquire and manage the data for research. The Oracle Secure Research Data Repository (OSRDR) is a company-wide resource available to research and development teams; the OSRDR provides the means to access and operate on sensitive data. This team manages the process to acquire and curate the data used for high-value research.
         As the OSRDR Tools and Workflow Automation Developer, you will be responsible to build and maintain tools to manage the data within the data repository, as well as creating workflow automation to improve the execution of the OSRDR governance process. Web-based content is maintained on Oracle’s internal “Confluence” system. Workflow automation will be a combination of shell and python scripts to automate routine tasks as well as developing a web-based application to automate approval workflow. You will interact with functional and  technical people to define requirements and resolve issues.  The successful candidate will have many of the same skills as a “Release Engineer”, but instead of facilitating software releases, you will work with the data scientists, system administrators, and other users to facilitate smooth operation of the OSRDR.
