        Senior Director Data Scientist- Small Business Banking
        At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.
        As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you'll be part of a team that's leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.
        About Small Business Banking:
        We believe Small Businesses are the heart and soul of what drives our communities and economy forward with their passion and dedication to their work and customers. Beyond our customers, they are our family, friends and neighbors. We're hell-bent on reinventing the way Small Businesses successfully manage their money, engage with their bank, and build meaningful financial lives. It's audacious work at a massive scale.
        Our group is relatively new to Capital One so we don't shy away from challenging the status quo of process, policy, and the sacred cows inherent in a financial institution. Our inspiration is our small business customer â€” their ingenuity, scrappiness and relentless optimism for the future.

        * Developing collaborative workflows that bring our talents together and serve as a model for the larger organization
        * Being a thought leader and valuating the landscape of tools to understand what will unlock new capabilities and performance and what is just a distraction, building and/or adapting to modern reporting tools

        The Ideal Candidate will possess the following qualifications:
        * Leader. You know when to speak and when to stay quiet. Your team gets the credit, not you. You probably have former reports that are now leading teams or companies.
        * Communicator. You can communicate complex ideas clearly, your team knows their priorities and so does your manager. Folks know why they're doing what they're doing. Maybe you're an introvert, or maybe you're an extrovert, but nobody accuses you of keeping them out of the loop.
        * Fearless. Big, undefined problems and petabytes don't frighten you. You can work at a tiny crack until you've broken open the whole nut.
        * Creative. Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don't frighten you. You're used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
        * Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You probably know Python, Scala, or R and you're constantly exploring new open source tools.
        * Wrangler. You know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and model it into human-readable form (ROC curve, map, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).
