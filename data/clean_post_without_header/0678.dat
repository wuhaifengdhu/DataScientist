          Position Summary
          The Regeneron Genetics Center is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company organized to collaborate with health systems and research groups to elucidate, on a large scale, genetic factors that cause or influence a range of human diseases. Building upon Regeneron's strengths in mouse genetics and genetics-driven drug discovery and development, the Center will specialize in ultra-high-throughput exome sequencing and computational biology; discovery of genotype-phenotype associations through linkage to well-annotated de-identified patient electronic medical records; and validation of discoveries using Regeneron’s VelociGene® technology. Our interests encompass a breadth of different areas such as Mendelian and family frameworks, large-scale population genetics (both common and rare variants), and gene-gene interactions. Program goals include target discovery, indication discovery, and patient-disease stratification. Objectives include advancing basic science around the world through public sharing of discoveries, providing clinically-valuable insights to physicians and patients of collaborating health-care systems, and identifying novel targets for drug development.

          - Familiarity with research environments and the provision of clinical and/or phenotypic datasets to researchers
          - Strong SQL skills. Familiarity with additional programming languages preferred
          - Familiarity with database environments and data warehousing concepts
          - Familiarity with Clinical/EMR data standards, coding schemes and ontologies (ICD-9/10, SNOMED, RxNorm, LOINC, CPT)
          - Familiarity with research databases such as REDcap and research cohorts
          - Experience with mining, interpretation and QA/QC of clinical and research data
          - Familiarity with statistical toolsets (such as R) preferred
          Level will be commensurate with experience.
