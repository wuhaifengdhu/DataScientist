          About the Job
            Enterprise Select has partnered with a revolutionary Biotech company in the Bay Area to help build out their cutting-edge Data Science team. As a principal data scientist in machine learning, you will explore an exciting new application of neural networks.
             Your role will involve architecting and training models on proprietary DNA sequencing data, generated by high throughput single molecule sequencing instrument.  This role will require a firm grasp of signal processing concepts for raw voltage signal pre-processing as well as intuition about model architectures and training.  You will be working directly with scientists from a variety of fields, including physics, biochemistry, electrical engineering and software engineering.
             If you are passionate about machine learning, big data, medical diagnostics and challenging scientific research problems, this is the opportunity of a lifetime!
             WHAT YOU’LL DO:
               Model design and training
               Raw signal preprocessing
               Application of statistical models to characterize behavior of an ensemble of single molecule sensors.
               Data exploration and collaboration with scientists from a diverse set of fields to advance DNA sequencer technology development.
             WHAT TO BRING:
               Hands on Deep Learning experience using TensorFlow, Theano or similar
