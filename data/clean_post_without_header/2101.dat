        Req Id: 71201
        As a Data Scientist Intern at Micron Technology Inc., you will employ techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, and information technology, including signal processing, probability models, machine learning, statistical learning, computer programming, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization, uncertainty modeling, Big Data, and high performance computing to uncover patterns in data from which predictive models, actionable insights, and solutions can be developed. You will interact with product, process, operations and/or service teams to identify questions and issues for data analysis and experiments. In this position, you will be expected to develop and code software programs, algorithms and/or automated processes to cleanse, integrate and evaluate large datasets from multiple disparate sources. You will also interpret and communicate insights and findings from analysis and experiments to product, service, and business managers.Responsibilities and Tasks Align to, Understand, and Prioritize Analytic Goals to Address Business Opportunities and Value
