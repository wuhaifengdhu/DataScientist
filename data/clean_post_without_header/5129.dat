        The Analytics & Informatics business line of the OCS business unit is looking to expand its presence. As part of our growth plans, we are looking to bring in an experienced hire to help build a Data Insights Engineering team in Atlanta, GA. This person will be instrumental in helping Varian establish an analytics center of excellence in Atlanta over the coming years and will serve as the overall technical lead of this hybrid engineering and data science team.
        Phase 1
        This role will initially be responsible for leading a geographically distributed engineering team to complete the build of our next generation data aggregation/insights platform. This will ultimately be a SaaS-deployed, cloud capable, semantic data platform that aggregates, structures, and processes multiple data types from multiple data sources.
        This hire must have experience in building and deploying industrial strength, scalable solutions of this type. Specifically, we are looking for experience in back end, server-side, semantic data stack development. The focus will be on the building and maintenance of ontologies and queries, federation across data sources, and integration with large-scale structured data. The hire will also be accountable for the configuration, deployment, and operations of the platform.
        Phase 2
        This role will then evolve into leading the build of a front-end application suite that covers the gamut of data visualization through dashboards to individually deployed analytics modules based on data science.
        The senior manager position will require management of data scientists who will work in collaboration with customer sites to understand their data and their needs. A key responsibility is to be able to make data functional, draw insights from it, and then visualize those insights so that they are usable by varied client audiences.
