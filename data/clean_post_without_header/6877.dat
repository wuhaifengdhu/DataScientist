            The Clinical Data Scientist (CDS) draws on their extensive clinical and scientific knowledge to ensure relevant
            data are collected on clinical studies and that the data collected are clinically plausible.
            The CDS will perform
            detailed review of clinical study protocols, ensure the data collection requirements are clear and identify th
            critical data elements required to be collected in support
            of
            the study endpoints.
            The CDS will interact with
            division personnel
            as
            well as perform their own independent research to gain a thorough understanding of
            disease states, procedural details and therapeutic areas.
            The CDS will interact with Data Management and
            members of the Clinical Affairs team to develop high quality and concise CRFs targeted to evaluate the study
            endpoints.
            He/She will provide input into
            the
            development of edit checks
            that
            examine medically meaningful
            correlations among the various data points.
            The CDS will routinely review clinical data to ensure clinical
            accuracy and proactively identify any trends that may adversely impact data quality.
            The CDS will
            b
            responsible for leading the development of reports that facilitate medical monitor and/or data monitoring committee review of the safety data as well as perform MedDRA coding of adverse events.
            The CDS will
            provide input into the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and actively participate in Dry Run review meetings
            conducted by Statistics. He/She serves as a resource for Data Management to facilitate an understanding of the

            accurately reflect the data collection requirements identified in the study protocol, and consistent with
            internal standards.
            Define edit check specifications and data review listings that examine correlations among the various data
            points and ensure the data is clinicaJiy meaningful.
            Review data on a continuous basis to ensure clinical accuracy and proactively identify trends that may
            adversely impact data quality. Communicate findings and ensure awareness across the study team and
