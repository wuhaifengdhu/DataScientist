        DuPont has a rich history of scientific discovery that has enabled countless innovations. DuPont Pioneer is a leader in plant biotechnology and predictive agriculture, delivering advanced plant genetics and data-driven advice to farmers. We seek a talented individual with expertise in computational and systems biology to join our data science team and help drive innovation in our research and development department, where we study a wide range of biological processes ranging from crop development and stress response to pest and pathogen interactions to genetic, environment, and farm management interactions.
        Duties and Responsibilities:
        * Collaborate with Principal Investigators and design experiments to optimize for relevant signal quality within budgetary constraints.
        * Contribute to the rigor and development of our data science team, keeping up with rapidly evolving technology.
        * Manage collaborations across geographies and time zones.
        * Work both independently and collaboratively with data engineers, bioinformaticians, and other analysts to accumulate, organize, normalize, impute, and engineer features from heterogeneous data sources. Dataset sizes range from small to large, some may be considered Big Data.
        * Develop rigorous methods to detect previously unknown patterns in data, such as latent factors, biological modes of action, and causal relationships.
        * Work with software development teams to deploy reusable solutions from proofs-of-concept.
        * Apply biological domain knowledge to gain new insights.
        * Generate hypotheses and propose new data types and experiments to test them.
        Education and Experience:
        * PhD in Computational Biology, Systems Biology, Bioinformatics, Computer science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics or a related field.
        Preferred Qualifications:
        * Computational Biology and Bioinformatics including quality assessment, analysis, interpretation and visualization of high-throughput sequencing data.
        * Systems Biology including the integration of data from many different biological components to develop models for the processes we study.
        * Supervised and unsupervised machine learning including deep learning.
        * Frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods.
        * Graph theory.
        * Scientific computing in R/ Bioconductor, Python/ SciPy/ BioPython, MATLAB, or others.
        * Proficiency in compiled programming languages such as C, C , and others, in order to read, understand, and modify code.
        * Databases including relational Oracle data warehouse, abstract NOSQL, and unstructured data lake.
        * Cloud computing environments, resources, and toolsets.
