        Who are we?
        The Content Engineering & Analytics team at Netflix has a clear mission - help the organization access and understand the petabytes of streaming data generated by our service to make great content acquisition decisions that spark the joy of our members. Our work encompasses all aspects of Netflix's content business, from licensing blockbuster shows and films and measuring their impact on our service, to assembling the ingredients for the next hit Netflix Original. As part of this effort, we tackle a variety of fascinating analytical questions: What is the best way to assess the value which a title delivers to one of our subscribers? What type of content should we invest in next? How can we measure the impact of our title catalog on subscriber retention?
        To answer these questions, we work closely with content experts and data scientists to develop an enviable suite of metrics, exploratory analyses, tools, and dashboards; all supported by robust data pipelines that scale with our continually expanding service (now in over 190 countries!).
