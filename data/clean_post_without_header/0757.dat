           About Bond Street
          Bond Street is a startup focused on transforming small business lending through technology, data and design. Small business owners are the foundation for growth in our economy, and yet today’s banking system has left them behind. We’re building a better future where access to financing is simple, transparent and fair.
           About Our Team
          At Bond Street, top engineers from companies like Venmo, eBay, Kickstarter, and Hunch have joined up with finance experts from places like Citibank, Bloomberg, and D. E. Shaw to disrupt the way small businesses finance themselves. We are based in New York City and are backed by an extraordinary group of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and financial services executives.
           About Your Role
          This is a rare opportunity to join a small but fast-growing team, where you will lay the foundation for our Data Science function. We’re looking for an extraordinary Data Scientist who is excited about the opportunity to build a next generation financial services business. We believe that there is a tremendous opportunity to employ cutting-edge data science to inform smarter, faster decision making.
          As our founding member of the team, you will shape the company’s data-centric culture, work closely with our engineering team to develop our analytics infrastructure, and collaborate with our Chief Credit Officer on developing, validating, and automating our underwriting models. Your models will have a direct impact on our customers in helping them access affordable financing and gain valuable insights to help them grow their business. While a background in financial services is not required, you must be passionate about solving complex data challenges for the good of small businesses everywhere.
