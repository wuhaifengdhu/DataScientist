        At Capital One, we're building a leading information-based technology company. Still founder-led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, Capital One is on a mission to help our customers succeed by bringing ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking. We measure our efforts by the success our customers enjoy and the advocacy they exhibit. We are succeeding because they are succeeding.
        Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.
        Sr. Manager, Digital Product Management
        In the Consumer Bank, we've combined that human-centered design with our heritage of data-driven decision-making to design, build and test our way to truly enabling financial experiences. We've challenged ourselves to spend less time planning, more time doing, and, above all else, to see the world through the eyes of our customers as they work to understand and manage their money.
        In this role you would be a product leader on the Cash Flow Experience team, which seeks to keep people on the path to financial success and to help them recover from any missteps. We analyze millions of transactions and behaviors to find potential problems and build great experiences, messaging, and alerts that drive awareness and provide the support to keep folks financially secure or get them back on track.
        On any given day on the team you'll be:
        * Empowered. Owning the success and life cycle of the experiences we create to keep people on a secure path and help them recover when bad things happen. This includes setting the strategy, defining key metrics and setting quarterly goals.
        * Learning constantly. Work deeply with engineers and data scientists in new platforms, and with clever algorithms to create native digital experience that protect customers from problems or help them recover in real-time.
        * Innovating relentlessly. Pushing big change by starting small, testing, and learning your way to effective experiences, or identifying key partnerships and creating space for something dramatic to happen.
        * Sharing openly. Telling stories that change the way people think about building products and solving problems, and that illustrate the power of what software can do to make them even better.
        * Connecting creatively. Jumpstarting a self-supporting community by sowing the right seeds, building the right tools, driving real focus, and just plain elbow grease.
        * Succeeding strategically. Solving the right problem, and holding on the wrong one. Getting big by starting small.
        Here is what you will bring to the table:
        * Leader. You know when to speak and when to stay quiet. Your team gets the credit, not you. You know building cool things is not just a team effort, but a vast constellation of relationships and challenges.
        * Communicator. You can communicate complex ideas clearly, your team knows their priorities, but feels free to innovate wildly inside them. Folks know why they're doing what they're doing. Maybe you're an introvert, or maybe you're an extrovert, but nobody accuses you of keeping them out of the loop.
        * Do-er. You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. Expect to tell us what you've shipped and what's flopped.
        * Fearless. Big, undefined problems, large organizational challenges, and petabytes don't frighten you. You can work at a tiny crack until you've broken open the whole nut.
        * Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your crazy idea. You probably have strange hobbies and even stranger friends, or spent the last two years running your company and sleeping under your desk.
        * Passionate. You care about growing others and bringing them together around what's possible. You've started meetup groups or taught General Assembly courses because you love enabling others.
        * Wrangler. You've gotten front-end engineers to play nice with iOS developers, you can inspire an ETL developer to write creatively about her latest pipeline.
        Here is what we will bring to the table:
        * Competitive salary and equity (including a robust 401(k) plan)
        * Excellent medical and dental insurance (and other health benefits)
        * Superstar product, design, data and engineering leaders [Paypal, Google, Gilt, Yodle, AOL, Adaptive Path]
        * Top class engineering teams that you will lead and build product with
        * Continuous learning budget
        * Highly supportive and "bought in" leadership environment
        Basic Qualifications:
        * At least 2 years of experience leading multiple cross-functional teams to deliver consumer experiences and/or core product platforms that power those experiences
        * Bachelor's Degree or military experience
        Preferred Qualifications:
        * A career in product management that gives you meaningful perspective on what it's like to begin your product journey, and makes you a powerful mentor and coach for others
        * Demonstrated experience balancing the evolution of in-market products with the space needed to innovate the next leap forward
        * Examples of where you took largely undefined areas of responsibility and created structures, rituals and process that made teams using them wildly successful
        * Experience using large streams of real-time data to power customer experiences that balance factors like adoptability, technical limitations, and consumer privacy
