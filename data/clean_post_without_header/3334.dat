        Principal Scientist, Data Science (Machine Learning and System Engineering),
        Roche Sequencing Santa Clara,is developing nanopore technology to making genetic testing easy, reliable and affordable. We are creating a revolutionary, low cost, portable, DNA/RNA reader that can be used to improve the lives of people in a wide variety of applications including the timely screening of newborns for diseases and the diagnosis of cancers and infectious diseases.
        Roche is looking for a motivated and team-oriented individual who is passionate about revolutionary sequencing technology. As a data scientist / algorithm engineer in our Statistical Modeling and Analytics Group, you will drive critical components of our sequencing technology development. Your role will involve a wide variety of activities related to "base calling" algorithm engineering, system simulation, and analytics.
        In developing primary data analysis algorithms, you will work with large experimental data sets generated by our proprietary instruments. A firm grasp of concepts from probability theory, signal processing, electrical circuit analysis, and machine learning will be essential for guiding algorithm development and system engineering. We ultimately must turn noisy electrical signals into accurate DNA sequences! We also provide analysis tools and strategic guidance to other R&D groups working on system chemistry and hardware.
        An additional, critical function in this role involves advancing a highly accurate system simulator and utilizing the resulting synthetic data as a supplementary training resource. Effectively guiding both simulation and analysis code development will require an ability to grasp the physical, biological and electronic characteristics of our single molecule sequencing system. Development and support of the simulations requires a candidate that is self-motivated and able to work well in an agile software development environment. Previous experience with data pipelines will be very helpful as well.
        To this end, you will be working directly with scientists from a variety of fields, including physics, biochemistry, electrical engineering and software engineering. The successful candidate must be excited to learn new concepts from these diverse areas and apply them to an ambitious, interdisciplinary project.
        Responsibilities Include:
        * Primary data analysis algorithm engineering
        * Application of statistical models to characterize stochastic behavior at the single molecule level
        * Enhancing a custom simulator platform and its associated data analysis pipeline
        * Collaborating with scientists from a diverse set of fields to advance system characterization (statistical) tools
        * MUST have scientific programming experience in Python, especially numpy / pandas / scikitlearn / matplotlib or the equivalent, such as Matlab and C/C++ experience and willingness to learn Python
        * MUST have a firm grasp of concepts from probability theory / signal processing
        * MUST have some experience with advanced statistical methods (clustering, Markov models, neural networks, regression analysis, principal component analysis)
        * MUST be excited about expanding your current skill set. If a new tool or methodology is needed, you will have the flexibility to spend time learning about it and apply it to the project
        * A basic understanding of analog electronic circuits is a plus
        * Experience with distributed computing or cloud implementation is a plus
        * Previous exposure to fields of bioinformatics, natural language processing, or similar is a plus
        * Who you are
        You're someone who wants to influence your own development. You're looking for a company where you have the opportunity to pursue your interests across functions and geographies. Where a job title is not considered the final definition of who you are, but the starting point.
        * PhD or equivalent experience in computer science, information theory, physics, electrical engineering, applied math, or statistics
        * Demonstrated potential to lead complex, long term projects
        * Desire to work as part of a team in a startup-like environment
        * Who we are
        At Roche, 91,700 people across 100 countries are pushing back the frontiers of healthcare. Working together, we've become one of the world's leading research-focused healthcare groups. Our success is built on innovation, curiosity and diversity.
