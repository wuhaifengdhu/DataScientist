          Description
          Celgene is a global biopharmaceutical company leading the way in medical innovation to help patients live longer, better lives. Our purpose as a company is to discover and develop therapies that will change the course of human health.  We value our passion for patients, quest for innovation, spirit of independence and love of challenge. With a presence in more than 70 countries - and growing - we look for talented people to grow our business, advance our science and contribute to our unique culture.
           Summary/Scope
          Celgene seeks a talented, results-oriented individual to contribute to our informatics and data management initiatives in Research and Early Development (R/ED).  This hands-on role interfaces with programs spanning both discovery and translational sciences where processing and interpreting multi-platform and multi-dimensional ‘omic’ data in pre-clinical and clinical settings is being employed to identify molecular drug targets, characterize MOA, prioritize clinical indications and generate patient selection hypotheses.  We are seeking an individual with extensive experience managing, processing, and applying quality control metrics and processes to a wide range of data types in support of R/ED clinical trials and drug development experiments while working in close collaboration with basic research, translational and computational scientists.
           Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:
            Help develop, enhance, and automate processes for queuing and prioritizing data management and curation requests
            Empower scientists with tools, processes and data structures needed to support project objectives, including data integration efforts that may span multiple studies or experiments
            Ensure accurate, complete and timely collection, delivery and tracking of analytical information from internal or contract laboratory providers or collaborating laboratories for curation, ingestion and delivery to computational and translational scientists
            Help define, deliver and implement R/ED, collaborator and partner laboratory analytical data management systems, processes and procedures
            Work with R/ED study teams to develop R/ED information management plans that outline data capture, data flow, data queries, manual checks, and data listings needed to ensure data integrity and interpretability
            Participate in comprehensive data review activities in coordination with project and study teams
            Work with computational biologists, computational scientists, biostatisticians and study scientists to resolve data quality issues
            Make data, including raw/interim data, available to R/ED department personnel as required
            Acquire user feedback to inform business requirements for future data systems development.
          Qualifications
           Experience and Education

            Demonstrated proficiency with molecular biology assay concepts and ability to support, develop and deploy laboratory and other research data management processes and procedures as they apply to complex, high dimensional data sets
            Extensive practical experience in curating and working with diverse but highly-connected scientific knowledge collections and their query interfaces to enable research hypotheses around compound targets, mechanisms of action, and patient response
            Demonstrated ability to understand and translate high-level scientific datasets and results into data curation and management strategies
            Proven ability to work in a team environment with clinical personnel, operational personnel, study monitors, computational biologists, biostatisticians, programmers, and medical writers
            Demonstrated proficiency with current software engineering methodologies, such as Agile, source control, project management and issue tracking
            Working knowledge of cloud computing.  Preference will be given to candidates with AWS experience
            Working knowledge of Rest APIs and container strategies strongly preferred.
            Knowledge of distributed database design and implementation, LAMP/ MySQL, etc. with capability to perform/direct/assess implementation of such databases
            Strong understanding of LIMS systems and systematic, relational approaches to data integration and data processing workflows
            Excellent skills in R programming and experience in additional computer languages such as Perl, Python, PHP, S-PLUS or Java (or C/C++)
            Experience producing visualization of data sets (eg., R/shiny, Spotfire, etc)
            Working knowledge of both Windows and Linux operating systems is required
            Along with programming proficiency must have creativity, and show a strong capacity for independent thinking and the ability to grasp underlying biological questions
            Must thrive in a complex, dynamic environment while adapting to dynamically changing priorities
            Must have excellent written and verbal communication and presentation skills
            Must have excellent time management and organizational skills
