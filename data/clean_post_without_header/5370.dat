          Technical Manager
          Why Our Technical Managers Matter
         Our Technical Managers are the influencers and leaders across multiple agile delivery teams. They are key participants in the delivery organization management team, overseeing the work of mobile application software developers and software quality assurance engineers across the business. Our Technical Managers take ownership of the Technical Design and User Stories supplied by UX and Architecture teams at the beginning of the project, and become the recognized expert of required feature functionality for the project. They work closely with Project Managers to maintain realistic task schedules for which all technical resources are prepared and available to meet delivery deadlines. Technical Managers should be able to put their fingers on the keyboard and write code, help troubleshoot complex production issues, and assist in the technical design of the systems and software.
         Technical Managers at Mobiquity are dedicated to our clients, and harness the best of their hands on experience with leadership and model behaviors. Our Technical Managers possess the unique ability to inspire, motivate and rally their teams toward the desired goal. The Technical Manager’s passion and drive to create truly innovative mobile solutions helps Mobiquity remain a top competitor in an ever-changing mobile industry, and encourages their teams to continue creating enterprise scale and quality solutions.
