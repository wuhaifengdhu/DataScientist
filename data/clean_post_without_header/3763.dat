        Use your Machine Learning skills to help people understand what’s happening in the city around them.
At Hoodline, we’re mapping the world around you. Our vision is to allow locals to discover the pulse of their city, and for travelers to experience a city like locals do.  At our core, we use technology to empower a community of local contributors to uncover news, information and untold stories, to sparking thoughtful conversations.
Our products have built one of the largest locally-focused audiences in San Francisco today, via a neighborhood news editorial operation, and a suite of in-house technology products.
By adding a unique taxonomy to local content — by time, location and context, plus our own NLP magic, we provide a rich local discovery experience, globally. Essentially, we’re creating a hyperlocal content graph, allowing us to answer and serve local related questions in real time.
Our city data tools let us break stories about new businesses and developments across neighborhoods, while our content management system makes it easy for our on-the-ground writers to tell their neighbors what’s going on. We connect people at the street level through better technology.
We’re planning new versions of our existing products, and some big new ones for our users, focusing on the ‘nearby experience.’ If you get excited about solving local content discovery, at the intersection of technology, community and content, we’d like to talk.
We’re backed by a range of top tech investors and journalism leaders, including Greylock, Social Capital, Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, the Knight Foundation, Matter VC, and Joi Ito, the head of the MIT Media Lab. Our team of 14 has years of success in consumer tech, online and local media.
We believe that the best candidates for our team are the talented self-starters that are looking for a challenge and meaning in what they build, can think locally and build globally. We offer strong compensation, early equity, product ownership and a ton of responsibility. Essential duties and responsibilities may include, but are not limited to:
   • Work closely with the product/engineering team, analyzing solutions to complex problems
   • Solve problems using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and techniques
   • Build data pipelines to enable data analysis at scale in real-time
   • Develop machine learning and data mining algorithms to extract meaningful information from thousand to millions articles
   • Develop scalable algorithms for text analysis to model context and location
Qualifications:
   • Strong background working with machine learning methods and experience in implementing and extending ML algorithms independently (Background in NLP/NLG is a plus)
   • Experience developing data infrastructure and tools
   • Familiarity with current large-scale data processing technologies
   • Strong software engineering skills and substantial expertise in Python, R, C/C++ or Java
   • Track record of effective collaboration in a cross-functional environment
   • Strong analytical and quantitative skills
   • BS/MS or PhD in Computer Science or related technical field or equivalent practical experience
