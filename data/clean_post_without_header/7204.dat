           About Clarabridge
          The Clarabridge team builds products to analyze and process customer feedback at large scale. Our clients use our software to analyze large amounts of both structured and unstructured data originating from a variety of sources (surveys, social networks, call transcripts, a.o.), and to respond to queries and complaints on social media. We use a variety of artificial intelligence techniques to streamline this process by offering deep insights into the data and by offering automation solutions where possible.
           Data Science at Clarabridge
          The areas you’ll work in include:
           Natural language processing (sentiment analysis, NER, SyntaxNet, …)
           Machine learning (both supervised and unsupervised, online and offline)
           Automatic reply and dialogue systems (bots)
           Big data
          You’ll be using proven algorithms and solutions where possible and conceive, design, develop, evaluate and maintain new creative intelligence solutions where needed, from prototyping to production, at scale.
          You’ll be collaborating with software engineers to integrate your solutions into the rest of the software, from design to production.
          You are familiar with or interested in;
           Deep Learning techniques (TensorFlow, SyntaxNet);
           Excellent understanding and proven skill in NLP and various machine learning techniques;
           Flexible in choice of programming language. Competent in one or more of Java, Clojure, Python with a desire to learn more;
           Knowledge of some of the main big data and NoSQL technologies, e.g. ElasticSearch;
           PhD in computer science/artificial intelligence or equivalent experience preferred;
           What we look for in people
           The curiosity and humbleness to second-guess yourself and learn.
           The patience to take some time and talk with others and share knowledge.
           The courage to take on big projects with loads of responsibility and ownership.
           The experience to use proven technologies, math, and libraries to everyone’s benefit.
           The pride to make the best product you possibly can.
           The wisdom to leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
          Let’s be honest: great data scientists who are nice to work with are hard to find. We hope you’re one of those! Our products are relying heavily on NLP and other machine learning disciplines (both supervised and unsupervised, online and offline), so you could say we have some big challenges for you to wrap your head around.
          The amount of data we work with could be described as “huge”, and we’re looking to add some deep learning to our toolset to conquer the data that we get to process. If you know a thing or two about TensorFlow, SyntaxNet or if you want to come and talk to us over a coffee about machine learning in general, please do!
