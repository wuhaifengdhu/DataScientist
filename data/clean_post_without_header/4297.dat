             We are an MIT Media Lab spin-off focused on understanding human emotion and using that understanding to improve the world. Our vision is that one day, technology will have the ability to sense, adapt and respond to not just commands but also non-verbal signals. We are building artificial emotional intelligence. As you can imagine, such an ambitious vision takes a great team with a strong desire to explore and innovate. We are growing our team to improve and expand our core technologies and help solve many unique and interesting problems focused around sensing, understanding and adapting to human emotion. Our first technology measures human emotion through remotely sensing and analyzing facial expressions. This technology is already being used commercially, and has been released to the public in the form of SDKs so that developers around the world can begin to use it to create a new breed of apps, websites and experiences.
              Responsibilities
             WE ARE LOOKING FOR A DATA SCIENTIST TO GROW OUR SCIENCE TEAM, TASKED WITH CREATING, IMPROVING OUR TECHNOLOGY.
