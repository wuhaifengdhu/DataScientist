           Engineering at FiscalNote
          Our team has a wealth of diverse life and career experiences that allow us to think outside of the box and ahead of the curve. And we laugh – all the time. You'll get the opportunity to work at an institution pushing the boundaries of open data transparency, while collaborating with some of the industry’s brightest engineers and data scientists to devise, nurture, and implement cutting-edge solutions to continuously evolving engineering obstacles.
          In becoming a FiscalNoter, you’ll enjoy a plethora of benefits that you would expect at both an established company and at a startup. More importantly, though, is the opportunity to develop software that impacts real decisions -- decisions that substantially affect governing in the US and abroad. You will hone your engineering skills among peers just as motivated and skilled as you are, and in the process, develop a tight-knit camaraderie that will transcend simple software development.
           About the Position
          We never rest in our quest to capture the most relevant and timely data possible. Our software engineers work at the tip of the FiscalNote spear, continuously aggregating large quantities of real-time open data. FiscalNote data scientists and policy experts rely on our software engineers to formulate and implement inventive methods of data collection in order to provide the top-tier analysis expected by our customers.
          Data acquisition is only the beginning, though. Excitement about building tools and frameworks to assess and address data issues is a basic characteristic of our software engineers. You will not be siloed, but rather, encouraged to reveal and attack any issues that need dealing with, data-related or not. You will be given the freedom to explore our business and our technology… and make it better. If you want to be empowered to work beyond basic expectations and join an engineering team energized to create what’s never been seen, you’re the ideal FiscalNote engineer.
