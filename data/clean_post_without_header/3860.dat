        Want to revolutionize finance?
        Earnest is a financial technology company building the modern bank for the next generation. We are a quickly growing team of math nerds, designers, computer geeks and relentless innovators going after a huge market by creating a company built on flawless design, powerful software, advanced data science and an incredible client experience. We believe that if we fundamentally re-engineered banking it would look and feel completely different to how it does today â€“ and that is what we have set out to do.
        Our team is made up of people who are both inspired innovators and results driven -- individuals who are prepared to roll up their sleeves, to challenge the status quo, to venture far beyond what's comfortable, and who are able to fail and get back up again.
        The Role:
        We're looking for an experienced and creative Senior Data Scientist to join our data team - the team responsible for making our vision a reality. This role will participate in all stages of the model building process, including data ingestion and model deployment.
        The models built by the Data Science team at Earnest touch all arms of the business. Examples of models the Data Science team is responsible for are credit modeling for underwriting and risk management or attribution, conversion modeling for marketing or business development initiatives, and optimization models to maximize yield.
        Responsibilities:
        This is a very collaborative position and part of the responsibilities of the role will be translating and incorporating business requirements appropriately into the models. Good communication skills and a desire to work across multiple teams at Earnest are essential. The business needs and challenges of Earnest are growing rapidly and the modeling challenges and the team will need to grow and adjust to those changes.
        The data and modeling challenges at Earnest are unique within the industry, so standard machine learning methods won't work out of the box. Custom methods will most likely need to be developed and deployed from scratch so creativity, innovation, and a fearlessness with respect to complexity are absolutely essential to this position.
        Qualifications:
        * MS/PhD in CS, mathematics, statistics, econometrics or another quantitative / scientific discipline
        * A proven track record of 5-6 years in all phases of the model development process:
        * requirements gathering
        * data ingestion
        * model building and tuning
        * deployment and integration of models to the rest of our production systems
        * monitoring of model results and impact
        * Expert in scientific or statistical programming (R, Python). The ability to build and train models from scratch is essential.
        * Experience and strong programming skills for deployment of developed models to a production environment (Python, Java, Node.JS, Scala)
        * Expert understanding of traditional relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) and distributed systems (Redshift, BigQuery, Apache Hadoop)
        * Desire to influence the shape and voice of the team through participating in the hiring process as well as mentorship of less experienced data scientists
        * A history of successful collaboration with other departments or in cross-functional settings
        * A history of developing disruptive ideas and the desire to build something truly novel and innovative
        * Past experience working in finance is a plus, but not required
