           Director of Data Science, Tech College
           At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.
           We areselectively recruiting a forward thinking, communicative, and entrepreneurial Data Science leader for our Tech College Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence discipline. As the leader of this discipline, you’ll be a technical expert who owns the machine learning and artificial intelligence curriculum and ensures that we have the right content through the right delivery channels at the right time. You’ll assess emerging needs, get a feel for future demand across Tech and the broader Capital One Data Science community, and plan for meeting those needs with the appropriate training content. You’ll need to be both a broad, hands-on practitioner of machine learning and someone who can organize and lead. You’ll have subject-matter experts on your team who will help in curating and delivering content.
           On any given day, you’ll be:
           - Meeting with leaders to understand current and future needs
           - Curating existing courses, videos, books, and other learning materials
           - Creating learning plans and paths for different roles and learning personas
           - Delivering in-person training
           - Recording off-line training content
           - Maintaining your own skills through hands on research and development
           - Identifying budget impact/needs for your discipline
           - Recruiting, mentoring, and leading the best talent to assist you
           You must have a passion for and a strong background in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the tools and techniques that support those disciplines such as cloud computing, relevant, open source programming languages, data storage, visualization, and business analytics.
           The Ideal Candidate will be…
           -Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your crazy idea. You probably have a diploma and an impressive GPA, or you dropped out of college, taught yourself and routinely win Kaggle competitions.
           -Wrangler. You know how to move data around, from a database or an API, through a transformation or two, a model and into human-readable form (ROC curve, Excel chart, map, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.). You probably know Python, Java, R, Storm, Julia, SQL, Matlab, Mahout, or think everything can be done in a Perl one-liner.
           -Do-er. You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. Expect to tell us what you’ve shipped and what’s flopped.
           -Fearless. Big, undefined problems and petabytes don't frighten you. You can work at a tiny crack until you've broken open the whole nut.
           Twenty-five years after Capital One was started it’s still led by its founder. Be ready to join a community of the smartest folks you’ve ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.
