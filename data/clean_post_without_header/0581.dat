        About New Avon
        New Avon LLC is the leading social selling beauty company in North America. We became a private company in March 2016, when Avon's North American business separated from the global, publicly-traded company, Avon Products, Inc. Our company has nearly 400,000 independent sales Representatives across the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, and generated over $1 billion in revenue during 2015. New Avon's product portfolio includes award-winning skincare, color cosmetics, fragrance and personal care products, featuring iconic brands such as Avon Color, ANEW, Avon Care, Skin-So-Soft, and Advance Techniques.
        For more than 130 years, the Avon brand has stood for beauty, innovation, optimism and, above all, for women. This includes proudly supporting the Avon Foundation for Women in its efforts to end breast cancer and domestic violence. We are committed to a purpose of changing women's lives â€“ enabling Representatives to build successful businesses that provide an avenue to financial independence and opportunity.
        It's an exciting time to join New Avon. We are transforming one of America's most iconic brands and building a modern, contemporary experience for our Representatives and their Customers. We are looking for change agents who are inspired by the opportunity to build New Avon's future. Join us and be part of a team that is re-igniting an American icon.
