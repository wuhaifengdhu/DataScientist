        Genscape's product offerings are focused on energy data which is captured via patented sensor technology. Beyond our revolutionary sensor IP, Genscape's offerings are all software/data-based product. The essence of all our commercial products are the result of some of the most talented software engineers in the market. We continue to expand our software suite through organic development and integration of acquired products, technologies & data. We have just launched an entirely new unified platform that is a complete re-architect and rebuild of the entire system—not simply a refactor and/or extension but rather a comprehensive next gen system. We are further evolving that platform to extend into machine learning, data visualization including augmented reality and mobile.
        To continue to build on the success of the product strategy and the next gen platform delivery, Genscape is seeking to hire a team lead to cover the application development of our consolidated software engineering team. This role will report to the MD of Platform & Shared Services. This is a senior role focused on the continued delivery of software via a team of talented application developers operating in a number of SCRUM teams today. This role requires collaboration across the rest of the technology leadership team to ensure alignment with the roadmaps of work streams including database development, devops, business intelligence, QA and architecture.
        This team lead will work with the across the organization in planning, design, development, testing, and deployment of application services. This individual will need to be a strong collaborator and communicator as they will work closely with the Product Developers to ensure that the engineers' activities are in line with the larger goals of Genscape's growth strategy. This individual will also work with the other members of the Platform team to establish and maintain design standards to ensure compatibility and consistency in all data environments.
        The role is a hybrid of manager and hands-on technologist working through architecture and also code-related work streams. Leading a global team on a day-to-day basis requires the hands-on co-development/code review activities to provide code-level guidance while also leading from a SCRUM/Agile delivery perspective. The role requires an in-depth understanding of code management activities and agile deployment methods where we maintain multiple environments across Dev, QA, Test, Beta, Prod, etc.. while servicing may products with one production platform. The activities also include working with our devops team on the continual optimization of continuous integration. Our new production platform is cloud-based and highly scalable which is essential for our platform strategy to deliver all products across one configurable platform. There are a variety of technologies we employ with the vast majority being open-source across the full stack of our cloud-based platform. The Lead will manage development activities with the full spectrum of technologies however our data services team has accountability for the data tier and we include our database resources with our daily SCRUM standups. This leadership role will also incorporate and embrace our off-shore partners working around the globe to leverage their dev & QA skills on the SCRUM teams. Support activities will also come into the role however our platform's architecture mitigates many of the typical risks seen in vertical product solutions so break-fix will be only a small portion of the job. Our Devops group handles the majority of support however some issues will escalate to the team lead role to address urgent issues with the team.
        We enjoy engineers who love to innovate and are remarkably passionate about software development in all layers of the stack. Exceptional software developers are as much left- as they are right-brain thinkers given the nature of design and development. Passion for software, drive toward excellence of solution and outstanding team collaboration where ideas can be bounced around for feedback are all aspects of culture we embrace. If you see software as a direct reflection of what you love to do/build and if you say to yourself: "Imagine… I get PAID to do what I love---explore, innovate and develop excellent software with awesome technologies," then please do come talk to us for this role and/or other roles we have at Genscape.
        We look for passionate technologists who love data as well as enjoy working in an autonomous environment where employees are encouraged to expand their careers, explore new ideas, and make a big impact where they work. Come see what we are all about!
