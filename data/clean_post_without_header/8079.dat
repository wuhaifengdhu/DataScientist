        For more than a century, L'Oréal has devoted itself solely to one business: beauty. It is a business rich in meaning, as it enables all individuals to express their personalities, gain self-confidence and open up to others. From make-up to hair color, from hair care to skincare and fragrances, our products magnify, beautify, soothe, moisturize, strengthen, rejuvenate... Regardless of a person's age, origin or personality, above all and before all, they enable her or him to care for what is certainly most precious to each man and each woman – and most fragile: the face, the skin, the body… in a word: caring for oneself.
        Our research budget reached €794 million in 2015, which represents 3.1% of turnover.
        In the last 10 years, our Research budget has increased more rapidly than the Group's sales.
        More than 490 patents were registered in 2015. Our workforce consists of 3800 employees, representing about sixty nationalities and thirty different scientific backgrounds (chemistry, physics, biology, dermatology, optics, rheology, IT, statistics, analysis, etc.).
        Asa data scientist specialized in machine learning, you will join our lab toreinvent our Research & Innovation and the world of beauty thanks toartificial intelligence.
