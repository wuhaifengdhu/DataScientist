        Legal Data Science Intern
        can be a remote position
        Interested in the intersection of the law and technology?
        Lex Machina is seeking an legal data science intern for flexible hours and schedule; compensation commensurate with skill and experience.
        About Lex Machina:
        Lex Machina provides Legal Analytics to companies and law firms, enabling them to craft successful strategies, win cases, and close business. Founded by law professor Mark Lemley, we are a cutting edge company based in Menlo Park, CA. Following our mission to be the most trusted source of litigation data, Lex Machina provides corporate leaders, attorneys, and policy makers with valuable empirical data and analytics that promote informed decision making and bring transparency to litigation. Lex Machina launched for patent litigators but we are now in the process of expanding Legal Analytics to all areas of the law including employment, commercial, bankruptcy and product liability litigation.
        Role:
        Our primary product is a web interface that lets practitioners easily navigate our data, but sometimes a deeper dive is required. You would work directly with Brian Howard, Lex Machina's primary data scientist, on various projects that cannot be easily handled through our main web interface.
        We will apply the data at our disposal to different areas of the law in order to create new insights: for example, revealing the most litigious parties in a particular sector, illustrating the relationship of caselaw to quantitative changes in case filings or motions-practice, or gauging the propensity of different districts to award damages.
        Responsibilities:
        * You will work on answering thought-provoking questions from customers, press, and law professors: identifying data that can answer the question, scripting an export of the data in some manner, and explaining the results as well as any caveats.
        * You will also work on data visualization and verification for Lex Machina's public reports and blog posts, which showcase how our data can be used to explore legal trends.
        Perks:
        * You can work remotely, or at our office in Menlo Park (easily accessible from Caltrain, catered lunch twice a week).
        * Flexible hours and schedule can accommodate classes.
        * Unique experience for someone potentially interested law school, but also great experience for a career in development or product management.
        Qualifications
        * You'll be working both with our database (postgresql) and our existing codebase and object model (python/sqlalchemy); you should be comfortable and competent with both.
        * Knowledge of basic statistics helpful.
        * Clear concise communication and good writing are necessary.
        * No legal training is required, but an interest in the law is.
        * You must be a voracious and passionate learner, eager to pick up new skills and ideas both technical and legal.
