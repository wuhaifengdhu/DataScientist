        BuzzFeed is an industry-leading media company. With a focus on native internet content, BuzzFeed publishes content on 30 platforms in 11 markets, revolutionizing the media industry and inspiring publishers across the globe to rethink how they present content.
        With a global reach of over 7B video and article views, BuzzFeed's Data Science team uses data to help solve problems that are complex and nuanced, at scale.

You'll be highly impactful across the business - from working with editorial to understand why content performs well to collaborating with executive leadership on how to leverage new data and insights. The ideal candidate will be a highly technical self-starter, will bring energy and passion to everything they do, and won't be afraid to roll up his/her sleeves to tackle projects both big and small.

        * Lead, nurture, and grow a team of Data Scientists
