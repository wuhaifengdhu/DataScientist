        ProPhase, a member of the WIRB-Copernicus Group, is a global provider of specialty solutions in clinical trials. Our goal is to optimize the selection, use, and analysis of behavioral endpoints to mitigate trial risk and maximize the likelihood of study success. Through collaboration and evidence-based innovation, we work to transform measurement science in clinical trials and improve outcomes for all stakeholders. Our services support all measurement-related activities in clinical trials and include eCOA and Endpoint Surveillance, Rater Qualification and Training, and Study Start-Up Support. By partnering with Sponsors, CROs and sites, and using a risk-based approach, we deliver services that are highly customized to study needs, and adapted regionally for global trials.
