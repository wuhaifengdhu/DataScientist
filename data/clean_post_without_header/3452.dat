        About Airbnb
        Airbnb's mission is to connect people to unique travel experiences, in more than 34,000 cities and 190 Countries. We are making it possible for hosts to supplement their income while helping visitors from around the world experience neighborhoods and communities outside traditional tourist zones.
        Data Science in a nutshell
        Here at Airbnb, we're big fans of travel. We love thinking about the diversity of experiences our host community offers, and we spend a fair amount of time trying to make sense of the tens of thousands of cities where people are booking trips every night. If Apple has the iPad and iPhone, we have New York and Paris. The tricky thing is, most of us haven't been to Cuba, so we try to come up with creative ways to help people find the experience they're looking for in places they may have never been. The data science team works in tandem with product management, engineering, and design teams to solve for things like this.
        Each data point we collect represents a choice by a user - creating a profile on our website, searching for where to visit, choosing the right place to stay, or accepting one guest over another. Our mission is to understand those decisions and help the company respond to them effectively. In some cases we work with product to build algorithms that learn and improve over time; in others we research concepts that can lead to new business opportunities; and foremost, we strive to implement rigorous A/B experiments whenever we can. We also work with non-product teams like marketing, public policy, and HR.
        Through data, we can stay connected to our community at scale, and doing so effectively requires hiring the right people.
