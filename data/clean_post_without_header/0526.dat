This individual thrives in a highly collaborative and cross-disciplinary team environment. We offer the unique opportunity to help shape the most ubiquitous and influential data products in the financial space.

        * Create and maintain information architectures
        * Conduct design QA for implemented user interfaces and work flows
        * Conduct sessions for user validation and testing by employing both qualitative and quantitative methods
        * Communicate design decisions effectively to senior stakeholders and team members alike
        You'll need to have:
        * A passion and drive for consistency
        * Undergraduate or Graduate Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Interaction Design, Information Architecture, Visual Communication, or any technical or design-related field.
        * 5+ years of experience with Interaction Design for software and web applications
        * Experience in several of the following: designing complex user workflows, decision-support systems, large dataset visualizations and framework-level interactions, information architecture, graphic/visual design, usability research/analysis.
        * The ability to use various tools for wireframing and prototyping
        * Strong teamwork and communication skills; we actively collaborate with everyone, from developers to end users
        * Familiarity with Agile and Lean UX methodologies
        * A strong understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript
        We'd love to see:
        * Experience with gathering requirements and translating them into features, functionality, content and information architecture
        * An understanding of workflow systems, software development processes and command center monitoring tools
