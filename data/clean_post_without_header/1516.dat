        The Advanced Scientific Computing & Informatics (ASCI) Department within the Information Research (IR) Division in AbbVie Pharmaceutical R&D is building the next generation of big data and decision support tools to optimize the efficiency and efficacy of research and development at Abbvie.
        In this mission critical role, you will define the technical vision and strategic direction for our next-generation data science efforts, optimizing existing approaches as well as cultivating durable big data, IoT/real-time, and scientific data science architectures for 2020 and beyond. This position requires a seasoned leader with a well-established and demonstrable track record of harvesting complex business and research use cases and converting them into powerful and flexible solutions comprising an effective composite of sourced and internally developed software and infrastructure.
        The end game is an efficient big data enterprise architecture and tool suite that empowers Abbvie's research scientists and business professionals to efficiently accomplish collaborative data science and decision making across the R&D pipeline, irrespective of the difficulty of the use case. This requires a flexible architecture and fluid tool suite that delivers unparalleled enterprise data actionability for any and all combinations of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data related to a variety of research related disciplines such as genomics, target validation, network medicine, and candidate discovery, as well as development related disciplines such translational medicine, competitive intelligence, trial design, safety, and health outcomes analysis. This position will be based at Abbvie's Global Headquarters in Lake County, IL.
        Key Responsibilities:
        * Define and lead a bold agenda around the use of data in new creative ways and develop the architectures and tools that allow data scientists to reduce it to common practice
        * Lead, influence, and mentor data scientists and software engineers within a cross-functional environment
        * Work with multiple, complex data sources at large scale
        * Influence big data and machine learning efforts to build predictive models and identify new data sources/patterns that add significant signal to predictive modeling capabilities
        * Communicate and champion strategic, long-range, and capital proposal and usage plans with high-level management in IT, finance, business-line, and strategy functions
        * Utilize your strong business acumen, intuition, and presentation skills to keep key stakeholders well informed of progress and milestones
        Some intangibles we're looking for in you:
        * You are intrinsically curious…you're not afraid to brainstorm new ideas that challenge the status quo…you value working and collaborating with sincere scientific colleagues
        * You are able to provide enough structure across the bushels of new ideas to develop actionable and resource worthy action plans
        * You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. You are seasoned enough to confidently convey what has worked and what did not and excited to apply that wisdom to the mission of discovery and developing new drugs for critical unmet needs in human health
        * You know how to move data around and integrate and visualize it; Strong background/experience with ETL, data mining, statistical analysis, data processing with very large amounts of data
        * You have intimate knowledge of challenge structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data use cases
        * Big, undefined problems and petabytes don't frighten you, rather, they inspire you, and you can't imagine your career moving in any other direction but into the eye of these challenging but rewarding problems
        Education and Experience:
        A minimum of 10 years industry/consulting or relevant academic experience is required. A PhD in computer science, computational biology, computational chemistry, bioinformatics or related computational science discipline is preferred. Highly experienced candidates with a relevant MS or MBA degree are also preferred.
