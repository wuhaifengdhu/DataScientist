        Oracle provides a range of Data Science technologies on Oracle Database and Hadoop/Spark platforms, both on-premises and in the Cloud. Technologies include R and SQL language-based analytics as well as a visual pipeline tool supporting analytical workflows. In support of data scientists, the R language and environment enables machine learning-focused customers to leverage this powerful and widely used statistical programming language with Oracle Database, Hadoop, and Oracle engineered systems. The group designs, develops, and tests the software and use case code temlates, engages with internal and external customers to leverage the software in both pre- and post-sales situations, and evangelizes/promotes the use of R through publications and conferences.
