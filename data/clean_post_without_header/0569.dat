             Senior Visual Designer
                RESPONSIBILITIES:
              Kforce has a client seeking a Senior Visual Designer in New York, New York (NY).
              Description:
              We're looking for visual designers who specialize in Information and Interaction Design. The appropriate candidate loves making sense of complex things (whether information, data, controls or even conceptual in nature) with the intention of reframing it into something simple, elegant, and actionable. You'll enjoy asking tough questions to help deconstruct the problem and mine for insights. And in general, you'll love producing high quality, clever, designs that elegantly solve the problem and not surprisingly delight the users. Ideal candidates are part inventor, part craftsman but most of all, makers.
              We sit within a Product Management organization and so we are serious creating tools and services that improve peoples' lives (at work) and achieve clear business goals. Our users have complex, fast-paced, informationally overloaded jobs (within an already complex industry) and so their tools must provide benefits without adding to it. As a UX team, we have to 'go deep' into the problem-space drawing from the various techniques designers have for finding insights that others can't. And, as with any successful product or service, our designs solve users' problems but also guide a product's evolution into a powerful and extensible framework.
              Operating similar to an internal agency, we'll take on a good variety of business-critical projects where design is a necessary part of the solution. In the New Product Development group, our role is to drive an agenda of innovation by helping to identify and evolve the best ideas by partnering up with our skilled team of data scientists, engineers, and business owners to figure out the best path to success.
                REQUIREMENTS:
                Minimum 4 years experience working in a professional capacity as a visual designer on highly interactive and data rich applications
                Above all, candidates should be excited and motivated to create next-generation user interfaces applying expertise within the fields of Information Design, Interaction Design, and Data Visualization to develop compelling designs for our products and services. Candidates should also have the following qualifications and experiences
                Be a trained Graphic/Information Designer who balances expertise in 'craft' with an academic interest in the relevant fields of Design (theories of visual perception and cognition, among other things)

                Can skillfully represent the visual design discipline, within a multi-disciplinary product team, when presenting to stakeholders, sponsors, and critics
                Enjoys new design challenges including those involving complex information, data visualizations, and interactivity
                Enjoys working collaboratively, taking and giving feedback in order to provide the best and most appropriate solutions
                Must be able to maintain healthy relationships with our business and technology partners
              Candidates must have:
                A proven track record creating design languages for an interaction-complex applications, sites, mobile et al
