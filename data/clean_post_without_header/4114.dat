        As a principal data scientist in machine learning at Roche Sequecing Solutions Santa Clara, you will explore an exciting new application of neural networks. Your role will involve architecting and training models on proprietary DNA sequencing data, generated by our high throughput single molecule sequencing instrument. This role will require a firm grasp of signal processing concepts for raw voltage signal pre-processing as well as intuition about model architectures and training. Due to the complexity of our sequencing instrument and multidisciplinary nature of the team, you will be working directly with scientists from a variety of fields, including physics, biochemistry, electrical engineering and software engineering.
        If you are passionate about machine learning, big data, medical diagnostics and challenging scientific research problems we'd like to hear from you!
        Responsibilities Include:
        * Model design and training
        * Raw signal preprocessing
        * Application of statistical models to characterize behavior of an ensemble of single molecule sensors.
        * Data exploration and collaboration with scientists from a diverse set of fields to advance Genia's DNA sequencer technology development.
        * Who you are
        You're someone who wants to influence your own development. You're looking for a company where you have the opportunity to pursue your interests across functions and geographies. Where a job title is not considered the final definition of who you are, but the starting point.
