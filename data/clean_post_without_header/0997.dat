               JP Morgan Intelligent Solutions (JPMIS) is a new group considering ways to transform and leverage JPM proprietary data assets into opportunities for JPM. Protecting and managing intellectual property effectively as well as utilizing it to develop solutions that are both customized and scalable will enable JPM to create additional shareholder value.
JPMIS is a relatively new group (3+ years, now over 300 professionals) that drives strategy and implementation of analytics and big data innovation for JPMC's businesses.

Tangible output of the programs typically are front line embedded decision making tools that change the way JPMC does business - powered by big data analytics.
The role is a mix of strategy consulting (defining the “what”, problem solving, client interactions), program management (leading the “how”- the development and roll out of data/analytics driven solutions) and occasional hands on analytics as part of rapid prototyping. The role requires excellent strategic thinking to engage with C-level executives on defining the data and analytics roadmaps that drive business value and then running execution for the programs in close collaboration with Data Science, DevOps and Big Data Infrastructure - all while ensuring 100% alignment with the clients (executives of the JPMC business)
