        The Bioinformatics Group Leader position in the Talkowski laboratory and the Genomics and Technology Core will lead a team of bioinformaticians and manage projects in a highly collaborative environment. The position will directly interface with faculty and investigators within the CHGR, the Broad Institute, and Harvard Medical School, as well as with national and international collaborators investigating the genomics of human disease. The group has a particular focus on neurodevelopmental disorders and has an integrated wet laboratory, computational genomics group, and Genomics Core, and the Bioinformatics Group Leader would oversee primary research projects as well as Core projects, interact directly with Dr. Talkowski and faculty leadership on other projects, and provide management to lab personnel and assist in the development of Harvard PhD students and lab postdocs.
        The Bioinformatics Group Leader will be responsible for leading a team of data scientists and bionformatics specialists in data management, analysis, and highly complex problems related to integrated 'omics studies of human disease. The Group Leader will also be responsible for training teams on new bioinformatics technology, distributing results to collaborators for Core projects, and leading the lab involvement in several large consortium efforts. Projects will include, but are not limited to:
         Directs analysis of all forms of genomics datasets, including whole-genome sequencing (Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, 10X Genomics), RNAseq, miRNAseq, ChIPseq, meDIPseq, and single cell sequencing approaches such as DropSeq.  Directs the development of software tools to enable analysis of structural variation from whole-genome sequencing and alternative splicing from RNAseq data.  Directs computational analyses to generate predictive models of disease biology from genome-wide datasets and outcomes data  Designs data management solutions, including storage of datasets and work products that optimize data-sharing and regulatory compliance
