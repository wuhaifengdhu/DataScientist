        Who You Are
        You love people. After all, the art of marketing is in creating experiences that people will remember and talk about with their friends.
        You are a connector. You look for opportunities to put people together so they can form new relationships and you aggressively look to broaden your own network within the company.
        You know that the key to being effective in any role is understanding who the various internal and external stakeholders are, so you work hard at it.
        You are a communicator. Let's be honest. If you're not clearly communicating what you're trying to do (whether it's internally or externally), you're going to fail. So, you work at it. You are a great writer, you use visuals, and you are comfortable talking to a group, inspiring them to action.
        You also like data. You know that the numbers aren't always the whole truth, but they give you insights.
        You're not afraid of math or statistics. You know how to use Excel - well. You are an execution fiend. You prioritize relentlessly as you see the connection between what you are doing today and what will (or will not happen) in a week, a month, or a year. You see the dominoes and you know which ones need to be knocked down first to achieve the strategic objective and desired outcome.
        And you are passionate.
        Passionate about marketing, but also passionate about the business transformation that the world is currently facing and you want nothing else but to be at the epicentre of it all.
        You aren't afraid to work hard, heck really hard, because you know that the process of transforming business isn't for the weak or the faint of heart. You don't mind it, you seek it out. Bring it on, you say.
        But, even if you have that, are you ready for Sprinklr? Truth is, it's simply not for everyone. We runâ€¦hard. The deal you make is an investment of total passion and commitment to the cause and clientele and a personality that says, "If I'm not being challenged, it's not worth my time." Or, perhaps you might say, "Go Big or Go Home."
        Whatever you say, you know that you are different from most of your contemporaries. And you're prepared to grit it out because your experience is that when you do, the rewards are worth it.
        Odds are, there are only a few people like you. Put simply, you feel a calling to be part of something special.
        What We Need
        We need someone who is comfortable wearing many hats. You'll be responsible for working with your regional sales leaders to build a marketing plan that drives objectives while simultaneously staying true to the corporate marketing strategy and core values of the company overall.
        You'll be responsible for heavily leveraging corporate marketing and creating market specific activities to drive results. Always, focused on driving results. Your outcomes will be centered on building awareness and perception of the Sprinklr brand and quantifiable lead generation and nurturing.
        On a day-to-day basis, you can expect that you will be involved in:
        * Ensuring that "no lead is left behind." Everything is followed up on and tracked. No exceptions
        * Planning, executing, and following up on Sprinklr events and conferences/trade-shows in which we participate
        * Working with the corporate content marketing team to ensure that relevant content lands locally and is distributed within the markets for which you are responsible
        * Nurturing PR relationships and supporting campaign launches with local PR outreach
        * Holding sales accountable for leveraging marketing material and executing in support of marketing activities
        * Serve as the "voice of the customer" in helping to shape corporate marketing strategy and direction
        * Managing the regional budget, negotiating with vendors, and keeping the trains running
        Requirements
        Here's what you will need to prove that you know how to do.
        * Data analysis (Excel) and Presentation creation and delivery (PowerPoint.) But not just the lightweight kind. You need to not only have a designer's eye, but a data scientist's mind. Have you ever created a Pivot Table?
        * Writing. Almost anyone can write, but not everyone can write well. Clear, concise, convincing. That's what we need. We'll want you to demonstrate that early on.
        * Personable. If people don't like you, you just won't be very effective in the role.
        * The ability to meet deadlines in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
        * The ability to work autonomously, be proactive, and take initiative and do so within the structure of the organisation and guidance of your leadership
