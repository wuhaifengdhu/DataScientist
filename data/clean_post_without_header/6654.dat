        Oracle Data Cloud (ODC) is a new division of Oracle with a startup culture and growth rate. We use massive amounts of data and some pretty sweet analytics to make companies like Google and Facebook smarter about their advertising business. Strategic Analytics (that's us!) is tasked with translating our analytical capabilities into new products and insights that help inform major strategic decisions for both our company and our clients, giving your work the opportunity to directly impact the success of this new division.
        We are looking for business-savvy Data Scientists to help us turn our experience measuring ads on the largest platforms into advertising gold. Our team owns the ODC Norms database, which is our repository of all past performance data that we have collected through our causal measurement product. You will use a variety of analytical methods to turn Norms data into insights that have a tangible impact on the performance of our client's advertising. Finding these insights is just the beginning, as you will be responsible for evangelizing and scaling new insights through: interactive visualizations, new product features, presentations at industry conferences, and any other means that you identify.
        Unlike other data science positions, you will be evaluated on both the quality of your analysis and the impact your analysis has throughout the organization. While some people find this responsibility daunting, there are some who view it as exhilarating – like you!
        Signs that you're right for this job
        * Working with insanely talented people brings out the best in you
        * You suffer from an incurably low tolerance for boredom
        * New ideas and technologies excite you - sharing them with others energizes you
        * You have little respect for the status quo
        * Deep down you're secretly a nerd... okay fine, maybe it's not that big of a secret
        Absolutely Critical to Success
        * First and foremost you are a problem solver - You are comfortable coding and using statistical methods but they are just a means to the end. You creatively apply the tools and techniques that you are familiar with and proactively pickup new ones along the way.
        * Insatiable curiosity – It's one thing to ask a lot of questions, but you take things a step further. You devour new areas of knowledge and lunge headfirst into new technologies, however, you rarely spend enough time to master either. As soon as you learn enough to be dangerous, something new piques your interest and you start all over again.
        * You deliver - In any given project there are dozens of things that go wrong. Rather than wait for problems to sort themselves out, you combine tenacity, strong work-ethic, and creativity to blow through roadblocks and deliver.
        Useful skills:
        * Experience using Python or R to manipulate data and perform analysis
        * Able to communicate complex ideas with data visualization (D3, Matplotlib, ggplot2, Tableau, etc.)
        * Comfortable working with SQL and relational databases. Experience with big data tools (Hive, Spark, Hadoop, etc.) a plus.
        * 2 years of experience applying statistical methods to solve real business problems or a MS in a quantitative field
