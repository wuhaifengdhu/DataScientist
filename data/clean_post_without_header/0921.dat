        Brookhaven National Laboratory is a multipurpose research institution funded primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. Located on the center of Long Island, New York, Brookhaven Lab brings world-class facilities and expertise to the most exciting and important questions in basic and applied scienceâ€”from the birth of our universe to the sustainable energy technology of tomorrow. We operate cutting-edge large-scale facilities for studies in physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, applied science, and a wide range of advanced technologies. The Laboratory's almost 3,000 scientists, engineers, and support staff are joined each year by more than 4,000 visiting researchers from around the world. Our award-winning history, including seven Nobel Prizes, stretches back to 1947, and we continue to unravel mysteries from the nanoscale to the cosmic scale, and everything in between. Brookhaven is operated and managed by Brookhaven Science Associates, which was founded by the Research Foundation for the State University of New York on behalf of Stony Brook University, and Battelle, a nonprofit applied science and technology organization.
        Organizational Overview
        The Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN) is a user-oriented research center whose scientific program is focused on the understanding and exploitation of energy-related materials, including polymers and organic-inorganic hybrid nanomaterials. The CFN maintains cutting-edge capabilities for materials synthesis and characterization. The CFN is a collaborative research environment, bringing together scientists with diverse expertise, including nanofabrication, electron microscopy, theory & simulation, and self-assembling Nanomaterials.
        Position Description
        Position Description
        The postdoctoral associate is expected to develop and perform in operando electron tomography study and aberration-corrected S/TEM characterization of energy storage and conversion materials. The research will involve the development of high-throughput and in-situ live tomography in the S/TEM. The work will be conducted in the Electron Microscopy group in the CFN, which houses five state-of-the-art scanning/ transmission electron microscopes. The majority of the work will be conducted on a FEI Environmental Titan equipped with a K2 direct-electron detector, a FEI Talos F200X equipped with X-FEG, Super-X, and Enfinium, an aberration-corrected cold-FEG dedicated STEM, and a Nion HERMES, first two of which have tomography, cryoET, and liquidEM capabilities. The successful implementation of the work requires coding capability and a close interaction with computer and data scientists/students working on deep-learning based algorithms.
        Review of applications begins immediately. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled. Research will be under the direction of Dr. Huolin Xin.
