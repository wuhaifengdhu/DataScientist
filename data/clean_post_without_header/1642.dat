          Position Overview:
          We are seeking a motivated data scientist to explore scalable methods that can enhance our equipment-generated data (like yield) presented to growers and internal research.  A successful candidate should be willing to leverage different data sources and modify existing models based on various constraints in the data.
          This position will be under the Geospatial Research team within our Science organization but will have significant exposure to various backend engineering and product problems as well.
          If you want exposure to real world problems in Tech that could have a significant impact in agriculture, The Climate Corporation would love to talk to you!
          What You Will Do:
           Independently develop scalable models and
           making conscious trade-offs
           that can meet constraints from
           Engineering and Product.
           Discover and communicate various constraints/issues from various agronomic data sources and how they could impact engineering, product, and science.
           Work across teams and expertises to assess data science products when ground truth data is limited
          Basic Qualifications:
           Candidates should be capable of independent research: a year of working experience with a PhD degree program in Applied Math, Statistics, Biostatistics, Computer Science, Physics or a related quantitative discipline or 3 years of working experience with a Masters degree in similar fields.
           Familiarity with the handling of outliers and missing values and their impacts on quantitative models.
           Familiarity with statistical software (R/Python) or Scala
           Experience partnering with cross functional and/or engineering teams in an industry or academic setting
          Preferred Qualifications:
           Experience with spatial statistics, time series, spatial data, agronomic data, or mechanical engineering data.
           Experience with Kalman Filters, Hidden Markov Model, or similar latent space models.
           Experience with complex data formats and data of varying quality
           Ability to modify existing methods given constraints from the problem rather than building a “universal hammer”
           Strong communication skills to solicit information from domain experts and present results back to different audiences.
           Ability to inform the limits and trade-offs to stakeholders as well as peers
           Curiosity and an open-mind towards unfamiliar data sources and unfamiliar quantitative domains
          What We Offer:
          Our teams are composed of industry experts, top scientists, and talented engineers.
          The environment is extremely engaging and fast-paced, with dozens of specialties coming together to provide the best possible products and experiences for our customers.
          We provide competitive salaries and some of the best perks in the industry, including:
           Superb medical, dental, vision, life, disability benefits, and a 401k matching program
           A stocked kitchen with a large assortment of snacks & drinks to get you through the day
           Encouragement to get out of the office and into the field with agents and farmers to see first-hand how our products are being used
           We take part and offer various workshops, conferences, meet-up groups, tech-talks, and hackathons to encourage participation and growth in both community involvement and career development
          We also hinge our cultural DNA on these five values:
           Inspire one another
           Innovate in all we do
           Leave a mark on the world
           Find the possible in the impossible
