         What is D2i? The acronym stands for “Data to Information”. The objective of the D
          2
         i project is to create a data-driven environment that enables users to reduce the time to information, and enable him/her to do effective troubleshooting and system monitoring. It does this by providing the service engineer with a dashboard of information and alarms that can be used to drive specific preventive or corrective action. The dashboard can make use of all available data sources (diagnostic logs, error logs, signal output) and then uses known properties or custom algorithms to produce information in a graphical interface.
         Objective is to grow the D
          2
         i concept in the semi-conductor industry to a platform that enables data driven hardware & process monitoring, and workflow control.
