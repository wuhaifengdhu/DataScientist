        What You'll Do
        You will collaborate with our client teams to effectively execute against project workplans and you'll assist in shaping the final recommendations to our clients.
        As part of that effort, you'll conduct core analytics with a high degree of accuracy and then work with the project team to formulate strategic insights for clients. You'll create and deliver advanced analytics using a variety of techniques including Purchase Structure, Usage Map, Segmentation, Econometric Modeling, and various other multivariate statistical analyses.
        Additionally, you'll assist with analytic plan development, manage information requirements (client, syndicated, suppliers), and utilize firm standards and processes to deliver workstream results on time and within budget. You'll collaborate with consulting teams to assure superior client satisfaction by providing hands-on deep analytics, and credible, insightful communication both internally and with clients.
        You'll partner with Persicope team members, client service teams, clients, and suppliers (syndicated, survey) in a positive and constructive manner, focused on the best possible end result. You'll have the opportunity to develop hands-on knowledge and experience with advanced analytic approaches and concepts such as Market/Purchase Structure, Growth Mapping and Segmentation.
