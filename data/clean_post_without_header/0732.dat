        Overview
        We're looking for a sharp graphic designer to help us make things.
        Things like the building upon world's best software-as-a-service predictive marketing analytics platform and its supporting marketing web pages and mini-sites and whatever else needs cooking. Maybe other things like direct mail magazines and unforgettable emails and TV commercials and pie-graph cookies and print collateral and custom squirrel suits and yes we're open for suggestions.
        We're small and fast and rarely furious. Almost never.
        Andy was really mad this one time but it was completely justified.
        You'll work side by side with our marketing team to help share our story with the world and communicate what we do and why it matters.
        Sitting on your other side will be our sales folks who will be thrilled to collaborate with you on presentations, reports, illustrations and other mysterious assignments.
        And situated both in front and behind you will be a collection of Customer Success Specialists and Data Scientists and who will say things like "Oh I still need to merge in the latest covariate updates with DB master..." but not necessarily to you just sort of to the room while thinking out loud. They are incredibly smart and a pleasure to work with on things like infographics and presentations.
        Custora is an established, profitable business delivering serious value to some of the best retailers in the world. But in many ways we're still very much an experiment.
        We're building a place where interested and optimistic people can seek fulfillment in creating things that help further our mission of making data more useful. It's an amazing opportunity to embrace fascinating intellectual, functional and communication challenges.
        Custora is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity at our company. We don't discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or socioeconomic status.
