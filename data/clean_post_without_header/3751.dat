              WANTED: Global Innovators To Help Us Build Tomorrow’s Enterprise
             This position's primary focus is to manipulate large datasets to extract meaningful business information using statistics and machine learning techniques. Individuals within the Data Scientist role are responsible for modeling complex internal problems, discovering insights and identifying opportunities through the use of statistical, algorithmic, mining and visualization techniques. In addition to advanced analytic skills, this role is also proficient at integrating and preparing large, varied datasets, architecting specialized database and computing environments, and communicating results.
             Our Data Scientists work closely with data stewards, project/program managers, and other IT teams to turn data into critical information and knowledge that can be used to make sound organizational decisions. Other responsibilities include providing data that is congruent and reliable. They need to be creative thinkers and propose innovative ways to look at problems by using data mining approaches on the set of information available. They will need to validate their findings using an experimental and iterative approach. Also, if called upon, Data Scientists will need to be able to present back their findings to the business by exposing their assumptions and validation work in a way that can be easily understood by their business counterparts. Excellent written and communication skills are required.
             Lastly, these professionals will need a combination of business focus, strong analytical and problem solving skills and programming knowledge to be able to quickly cycle their hypothesis through the discovery phase of the project.
