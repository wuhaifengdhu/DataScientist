This senior-level contributor coordinates the creation, implementation, maintenance and enhancement of a given method (model, algorithm, measurement approach, etc.), and acts as a subject matter expert in that method. This individual will interface with product managers and business leaders to define practical requirements for new methods and models, and translate these to a level of specificity that can be interpreted by a data scientist and/or software engineer. Methods Analysts are also responsible for translating complex technical or clinical concepts into formats that are easily understood by a typical audience of internal and external customers. A successful Methods Analyst will have strong skills in the technical disciplines, a foundational understanding of clinical terminology and concepts, and an overall understanding of care delivery and payment systems. While they do not need to be a statistical or clinical expert, they will work closely with those resources and must understand the appropriate questions to be asked and approaches to be evaluated in doing so.  The Methods Analyst should have experience in performing detailed analysis on large disparate datasets using a variety of tools and evaluating the results of applied algorithms and statistical models.
