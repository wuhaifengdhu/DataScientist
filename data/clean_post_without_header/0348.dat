        Company Description
         What we do:
         There’s someone you know, maybe related to you, maybe a friend, maybe a colleague, maybe yourself, whom you’ve seen at some point struggle and become frustrated with the question of ‘what am I doing with my life – what’s my path?’ This might start early; say in college when one has the opportunity to choose from 1000s of courses but the time and money for only about 30-35. It might start after graduation, being unable to figure out how that degree and those courses equate to the qualification requirements or job descriptions of employers. It might start after a few years of work, realizing the present path is just not the right path but not knowing what else there is or how to find it.
         SkillsEQ ( www.skillseq.com ) is taking a very ambitious approach to fixing one of society’s most enduring market failures: career path planning and management. There are thousands of companies trying to address parts of this problem, but it’s mostly a case of old wine in new bottles. We believe we have the solution.
         We’ve bootstrapped everything to date (we’re in the process of raising a seed) and have an operational 1st stage product in place - now it’s time to aggressively expand that product’s capabilities, break a lot of stuff, learn even more, and start making an impact on people’s lives and well-being.
         Why you’d like us:
         We are NOT a company looking for data analysts.
         We are NOT a company looking for website traffic analysts.
         We are a company that considers our data our product.
         This is a genuine data science role whose purpose is to develop the models and algorithms necessary to drive our service. This is one of the most important, central roles in our company.
         We’ve spent time in corporate environments where the norm was meetings about calls about meetings, political games, and having to go ‘up the ladder’ to get anything done - we commit to never allowing that into our culture. We strive for a productive, fascinating, motivating, honest, open, flexible, smart, empowered, enjoyable work environment.
         One of our primary goals is to create a company recognized as a leader for data science and algorithmic modeling, technical elegance and sophistication. We’d like you to join us and help make that happen.
