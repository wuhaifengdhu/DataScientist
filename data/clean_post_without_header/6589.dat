         Our Government high-profile client is in the second year of investing in a revolutionary way of using open data to promote economic development in the state of Colorado. We are providing data analyst and data wrangling support for their initiative. We are responsible for helping make certain state data public-domain and easier to use to allow other companies to leverage to build into their product and services or new applications. We are looking for people that believe data is the new gold.
         We are looking for data analysts, data wranglers, data scientists with excellent leadership, technical, and subject matter expertise qualities.  We are bringing together data sources from disparate sub-agencies into an enterprise platform to make available on open-data platforms.
         To boot, we want our analysts to be natural change agents and passionate about change while empathetic to the clients environment on how they leverage, mature, and incorporate data products, services, and new capabilities. We want leaders who can both support the influence of the right change direction while managing the technical and business analysis and design, and are skilled and self-motivated with solid domain/subject matter expertise.
         Our analysts will be on teams that through facilitated analysis, work shoulder-to-shoulder with the clients and our project leadership to get this raw, and sometimes unstructured data into the platform in agile releases. Furthermore, we are working with the extended part of the overall team to devise and craft strategies and communications solutions to broadcast and brag about their change efforts and results.
         This is what we do – we bring transformations to life.

Within the first half of the year, likely a total of 40 datasets, with increasing complexity will require the same level of effort as well as design and additional and documentation of the  transforms, implement ETL scripts as well as participating in design of improved data maintenance solution.  Some data will be raw, so being creative in problem-solving while meeting client tight goals will be very important.
