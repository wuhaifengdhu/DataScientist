        Job Summary
        Job Summary
        The National Renewable Energy Laboratory is looking for a Chief Theorist in materials science to build on its strong tradition in the application of advanced theory and computation to problems in renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as emerging programs in the integration of theory and experiment to accelerate materials discovery and development. The candidate would also be the group leader of a theory group within the Materials and Chemical Science and Technology Directorate, responsible for technical leadership, management and professional development of solid-state theorists.
        We seek highly motivated candidates with a demonstrated track record to contribute to current programs and with a vision to develop new programs and new directions in materials science theory. We seek candidates with a deep knowledge of fundamental theoretical science and its application to important problems in materials science, with the capability and interest to work across the fundamental and applied energy space. Candidates should have a demonstrated ability to initiate and execute programs in areas related to NREL's mission and broad research portfolio. The successful candidate will develop and apply predictive theories and new theoretical methods to the study of novel functional materials with properties relevant to energy conversion, storage, utilization or efficiency and will work closely with NREL senior management, theorists and experimentalists to develop and execute new research directions.
        Research areas would utilize high performance computing to address electronic, structural, vibrational, optical, or magnetic phenomena and properties of materials at the atomic, nano- or meso- scale. Research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, materials discovery, opto-electronic materials, functional materials, quantum materials, strongly correlated electron systems, or dynamic phenomena, including transport of atoms, charge or spin, as well as phenomena on ultrafast time scales. The position will likely involve a joint appointment at one of the universities within the Colorado front range.
        Excluded research areas are those focusing exclusively on organic materials, soft matter, and biophysics.
        JOB DUTIES:
        * Create and lead a theory and computation center of excellence for advanced materials at NREL
        * Establish NREL as a focal point for the development and integration of materials properties repositories and databases, both theoretical and experimental
        * Contribute to and lead projects in the Center for Next Generation Energy Frontier Research Center as a co-Principal Investigator
        * Mentor and professionally develop staff, postdocs, students and early career scientist
        * Develop international level of recognition for NREL in theory and application of theory to energy problems.
        * Advise management on new scientific directions
        * Develop external funding sources, including significant new scientific projects.
        * Develop new programs and initiatives in fundamental and applied materials discovery and development
        * Lead and champion new initiatives in theory and application of theory to energy problems
        * Initiate, plan and direct research including projects and programs particularly those that integrate theory with NREL's experimental capabilities and mission
        * Lead appropriate aspects of materials software development
        * Create a repository of computational tools and make NREL the point of reference for the sustainable development and distribution of software for materials discovery and characterization;
        * Help develop an integrated infrastructure in which state-of-the-art materials theory and computation, experimentation (materials synthesis, materials growth, advanced characterization) and data science are seamlessly linked together for materials discovery
        REQUIRED SKILLS:
        * Demonstrated expertise in theory, modeling, and simulation for condensed matter and material science.
        * Outstanding record of scientific and technical accomplishments in materials science and condensed matter theory as evidence by publications, citations and/or invited presentations.
        * Demonstrated ability to write proposals and secure competitive funding. Knowledge and expertise in one or more of the following areas: electronic structure, fundamental materials properties, inter facial science, correlated electron systems, nanoscale structures, multi- scale modeling including "mesoscale."
        * Demonstrated ability to apply fundamental science and theory to challenges in energy and to interact with experimentalists in a broad-based energy "use-inspired" environment focusing on new and existing energy technologies.
        * Demonstrated ability to build and lead teams involving staff scientists, post-doctoral researchers and students
        * Excellent written and oral communication skills.
