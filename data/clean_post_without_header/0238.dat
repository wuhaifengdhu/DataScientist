          The Applied Data Science (ADS) team is the advisory arm of Civis Analytics, working closely with companies, nonprofits, and campaigns to help solve their toughest challenges with data science.
          The Civis ADS Team leads Civis’s involvement in the multi-firm Census Integrated Communications Team, which supports all outreach, marketing and advertising conducted in support of the 2020 Decennial Census. As part of this team, Civis works closely with our partners to develop the data analytics that drive all aspects of Communications strategy, as the US Census Bureau strives to ensure that as many Americans as possible self-respond to the Census, and that all segments of the US population understand the importance of participation. The US Decennial Census, conducted every 10 years since 1790, is one of the most critical and long-standing projects in the US government - the Census count is used to apportion seats in the US House of Representatives, and to distribute more than $400 billion in federal funds to local, state and tribal governments each year.
