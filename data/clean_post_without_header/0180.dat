        The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) owns a fleet of geometry cars and has been operating, maintaining and managing such cars by contract under Automated Track Inspection Program (ATIP) for more than 30 years. The data collected from those cars between September 21, 1998 and present is stored in the FRA's Track Data Management System (TDMS). TDMS Web is made available to approximately 130 FRA and state track inspectors, 25 FRA Headquarters employees, and 50 railroad management employees.
        The employee will maintain the FRA TDMS application and provide data dissemination and data analysis services. Additionally, the employee will assist with maintenance and update support for the ATIP portion of the FRA public website.
