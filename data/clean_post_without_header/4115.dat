        Netflix is revolutionizing the way entertainment is consumed by people all over the world. We are also changing the kinds of entertainment people watch with groundbreaking new titles and formats. We are still in the beginning stages of our journey to become the biggest and most data-driven studio the world has ever seen â€¦ and we need a talented data scientist to help us take it to the next level.
        When we decide how to promote content to our members, we do it through rigorous experimentation and deep dives into user behavior. As a data scientist on the Science & Algorithms team, you will answer, through experimental design, statistical modeling, and analysis, questions such as:
        * What is the best way to build excitement for our titles before they launch on the service?
        * How can we design algorithms to find the right target audience for our titles, knowing we have multiple new titles launching every week?
        * How can we push the bounds of video-based features to promote titles in a way that feels as cinematic as a trailer in the movie theater?
        * Can we use "big data" to unlock the mystery of "word-of-mouth" and "influencer impact"?
