          At Civis, we take protecting data seriously and are looking to add another security engineer with security and compliance expertise. As a Senior Security Engineer, you will work with our General Counsel and team of DevOps Engineers on the constant stream of new products and technologies used to support our cloud platform.
          You will proactively find and fix security problems, monitor our networks utilizing security tools such as SIEM and next-gen endpoint protection, and prioritize efforts based on risk.  You sweat the details.  You’ll join our Chicago-based technology team, closely collaborating with other engineers and data scientists.
          We are looking for individuals from a wide range of backgrounds with demonstrated quantitative and problem-solving skills. We value creativity, hard work and on-the-job-excellence and offer competitive compensation and benefits packages. In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify their identity and eligibility to work in the United States.
          What's great about being an engineer at Civis? We believe in ownership of our work and continuous learning, and we set up our team to reinforce those values.
          We trust engineers from all over our team to pick the right architecture, library, or framework for the job at hand. Civis security engineers set the strategic vision for our compliance plan in addition to the day-to-day details, and they work directly with the legal and sales teams to come up with novel ways move the business forward while keeping our systems secure.
          We want you to never stop learning. Everyone has a mentor from day one and tracks their personal development alongside their technical deliverables. On the security engineering team, you’ll be joining a small core of infrastructure engineers and will help steer the course of our operations.  You’ll work with compliance frameworks such as SSAE16, HIPAA, FERPA, and FedRAMP, perform routine vulnerability testing of our corporate office and AWS networks, help manage third-party penetration tests, and pretty much work with every AWS service available (seriously).  Valuing continuous learning means recognizing that our strongest contributors stand out for their capabilities and not their credentials.
