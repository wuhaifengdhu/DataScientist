        As a not-for-profit organization, Partners HealthCare is committed to supporting patient care, research, teaching, and service to the community by leading innovation across our system. Founded by Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, Partners HealthCare supports a complete continuum of care including community and specialty hospitals, a managed care organization, a physician network, community health centers, home care and other health-related entities. Several of our hospitals are teaching affiliates of Harvard Medical School, and our system is a national leader in biomedical research.
        We're focused on a people-first culture for our system's patients and our professional family. That's why we provide our employees with more ways to achieve their potential. Partners HealthCare is committed to aligning our employees' personal aspirations with projects that match their capabilities and creating a culture that empowers our managers to become trusted mentors. We support each member of our team to own their personal development—and we recognize success at every step.
        Our employees use the Partners HealthCare values to govern decisions, actions and behaviors. These values guide how we get our work done: Patients, Affordability, Accountability & Service Commitment, Decisiveness, Innovation & Thoughtful Risk; and how we treat each other: Diversity & Inclusion, Integrity & Respect, Learning, Continuous Improvement & Personal Growth, Teamwork & Collaboration.
        General Summary/Overview
        The Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS) aims to transform healthcare through cutting-edge data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. We combine a translational, product-focused, early-stage culture with the world-class researchers, physicians, and data/computing resources at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General (MGH) and Brigham and Women's Hospitals (BWH), as well as the broader Partners HealthCare system. Given our direct access to vast stores of biomedical data, decades of clinical experience, and deep expertise in the latest advances in cognitive computing, the CCDS is perfectly positioned to lead AI enabled advancements in medicine.
        We are seeking an Innovation Fellow to support the center's effort to drive the translation of machine learning to clinical practice. The focus of the CCDS Innovation Fellow position is twofold: 1) To identify and characterize clinical needs that can be solved through the application of machine learning and automation, and 2) to support more experienced data scientists and software developers with development of tools and algorithms to address these clinical needs. This position aims to facilitate a core requirement of the center – to interface with clinicians and hospital personnel to identify opportunities, spearhead the development of machine learning solutions, and proceed with the implementation of these solutions. With unparalleled access to clinical data and expert clinicians, as well as a world-class information technology (IT) team, the CCDS provides an ideal environment for focusing on using analytics to effect tangible advancements in medicine.
        The CCDS Innovation Fellow will work with other fellows and the broader CCDS team to engage in the development of projects that are key to the objectives of the center: identifying, developing, and translating machine learning solutions to MGH, BWH, the Partners organization and beyond.
        Fellows will be selected based on their experience, passion, and abilities, as well as their potential to become leading innovators in the health tech field. This position is a full-time, paid and benefited 15-month position, with the potential to be extended for an additional 9 months.
