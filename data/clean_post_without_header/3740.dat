        The Role
        We are looking for an experienced individual who is passionate about data science and enjoys working in a collaborative environment. Members of the Content Science team typically work on one or two projects (e.g. predicting movie viewership) over any six month period. Machine learning is the team's primary tool. However, data scientists may also find themselves utilizing descriptive analytics, crowdsourcing, causal inference, network science, A/B testing and data visualization. While we partner with engineering teams, we do a great deal of coding ourselves, and the ability and desire to code is a must. We primarily use Python for development, but maintain the flexibility to use the best tool for the job.
