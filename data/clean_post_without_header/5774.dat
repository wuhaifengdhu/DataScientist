          The Data Science department focuses on transforming data into actionable business insights by building predictive models using machine learning and statistical modeling techniques. Our analytics team works with various key functions in our organization like Sales, Marketing, Operations, Human Resources and Finance and recommends actionable insights by putting our residents first in any core decision process. The Data Scientist enjoys working with our richer data sets and cutting edge technology and sees his/her insights turned into real solutions for our business.
          The Data Scientist is a data expert who mines the data and formulates/delivers predictive insights by blending the right art and science. He/she uses powerful data visualizations to present his/her findings with actionable recommendations.
          This individual builds models and forecasts within an enterprise-class model building and deployment framework that allows rapid deployment of predictive models directly into business operations. The Data Scientist helps to improve model prediction and its associated processes on a continuous basis by completing tasks including, but not limited to, evaluation of the models in the field, model refreshes, retraining of existing models, and assisting with road shows to educate the team on the field. Other tasks may include model evaluation/selection/diagnostic techniques, design of experiment support, sampling designs, visualizations, and simulations.
           Employ various statistical techniques to provide customer insights via customer profiling, segmentation analysis, and data mining.
           Mine databases and other data sources for insights and perform analysis.
           Analyze trends and patterns in structured and unstructured data in support of business problem solving. Participate in all phases of the analytic lifecycle.
           Serve as the statistical expert and train/mentor others in the organization.
           Build predictive models and implement into business operations, and refresh, measure and monitor the performance of the models.
           Develop insights from the analysis to provide business recommendations by identifying meaningful indicators and trends.
           Query structured/unstructured data and perform exploratory data analysis on customer data and provide actionable insights.
           Present ideas/findings with actionable recommendations and data story-telling.
           Participate in the delivery of analytic work that supports business objectives and priorities.
           Consistently seek knowledge from the industry trends in terms of implementing latest cutting edge statistical techniques.
           Perform any other ad-hoc analytics.
           May perform other duties as needed and/or assigned.
