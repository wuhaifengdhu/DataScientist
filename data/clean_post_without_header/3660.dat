           About HealthTap
          HealthTap is the first global virtual health practice, powered by more than
           100,000 U.S. doctors

           You can search the world's largest library (5.5 billion answers served over six years) of peer-reviewed doctor knowledge for any health topic
           Or ask help from Dr. A.I, our virtual “physician” who translates your symptoms into personalized, doctor-recommended insights—trained by HealthTap’s doctor network
           And if needed, connect with a doctor for a live virtual consult through voice, video, or text—and get prescriptions, labs tests, and referrals afterwards
          Not only have we served more than250 million people over the past six years, we have also partnered with
           the most reputable health providers and health payors
          -- from New Zealand to the United States -- who are
           using our
           HOPES
           platform to help their patients receive and doctors deliver faster, more affordable, and high-quality care
          .
          We’re a venture-backed (with the likes of Khosla, Eric Schmidt, and Mayfield Fund) health-tech startup based in the heart of Palo Alto.
           What’s the opportunity?

           your own
           interdisciplinary team to drive engagement for the partners we work with around the world

           growth engineers, growth product marketing managers
          ,
           doctors and patients
          to brainstorm, prioritize, ship, and analyze growth interventions around the metrics you try to move.
