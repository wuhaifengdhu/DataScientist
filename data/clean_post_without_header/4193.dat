          The Liquidity function, which resides within the Finance organization, operates at the intersection of finance, technology, and data analytics, leaning more towards data science than traditional finance roles.  In this role the candidate will work collaboratively with business lines, risk, accounting, and technology teams to generate and explain data-driven insights that have a direct impact on the firm’s operations.  The Liquidity team is provided a high degree of autonomy to devise innovative solutions to business challenges, and is laser focused on using the right tool for the job, as opposed to doing things “because that’s the way it’s always been done”.  With this in mind we strive to continuously improve upon processes, and build scalable automated solutions for managing liquidity risk.
          Routine responsibilities include liquidity stress testing, generation and automation of deposit reporting and related statistical analysis, deposit concentration risk management, forecasting, and policy ratio projections.  This role will be a primary point of contact for the Finance organization in the ongoing development of the risk data marts, and the development of future reporting platforms to support the aforementioned analytical processes.   The successful candidate will be a team player who can deliver highly performant, configurable, and auditable solutions that are complementary to existing processes, and which will enable non-technical users to respond quickly to unfolding events that have liquidity and/or overall balance sheet implications.
