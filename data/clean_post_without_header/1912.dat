          CUSTOMER SUMMARY
         Our client is a creative and innovative technology startup with strong backing, working to bring next generation set of knowledge discovery capability to our customers. This can only done by having a team of ambitious, self starting, stellar employees. They provide an outstanding work environment with options of telecommuting and flexible working hours. Employees are provided the best technology, are provided competitive compensation and benefits, and have the opportunity a chance to working in a really fun environment with expert engineers.
         Our client provides a game changing disruptive technology attempting to solve knowledge discovery problems. Their customers such as the National Defense and Homeland Security clients depend on rapid, cost-effective solutions and advanced technology - adaptable, interoperable, integrated solutions that provide high performance in quick-response scenarios. They are dedicated to providing these solutions using our core product, tailored variants of it - or in the future new products we develop to solve problems we encounter along the way.
          JOB OVERVIEW
         Our client is looking to augment their R&D/product development team for their core product, with a software developer that has experience with algorithmic design and implementation for large scale unstructured data. This developer will work with a team of product oriented engineers and subject matter experts to construct ways to intelligently harvest data, process it, and recommend insights for our user base. Top candidates will demonstrate a unique ability to solve difficult problems with advanced computational techniques.
          JOB REQUIREMENTS
         All members of our core product team will be responsible for helping to build and maintain in the open source project and associated product lines. Team members will maintain the existing code base and deployed architecture as well as research and develop high quality new software, unit tests, and processes.  They are also expected to participate in development, integration and architecture activities. We are looking for smart people who have demonstrated the ability to pick up and master new technologies as they are created - so your resume should demonstrate examples where you have done that. Candidates for this team should have most of the following requirements.
           A four year technical degree and at least three years of professional experience or seven years of demonstrable technical experience with no degree.  Acceptable degrees include, but are not limited to Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics, IT, and Engineering.
           A good understanding of object oriented design techniques and solid experience with Java. If you're a really good C++ programmer and don't mind writing in Java, that would also be fine.
           Knowledge of the Web 2.0 development platform and solutions, (e.g. DHTML, JavaScript, JSON, XML, JSP, and Flash).
           Understanding of general networking concepts (TCP, sockets, HTTP, SSL, etc)
           Understanding of enterprise networking concepts (DNS, TCP, Firewalls, Proxy Servers)
           Experience with Apache and Apache Tomcat server in Linux (Ubuntu, Redhat/CentOS) environments.
           Experience using Amazon EC2 Web Services or other cloud environments.
           Experience building software for any of the following functions: data visualization, business intelligence, intelligence analysis, risk assessment, financial analysis, geospatial or temporal analysis.
         Their core product team is a cross-functional team of developers that works in an agile (SCRUM-based) environment.  This position specifically requires someone who has worked on projects developing software to generate smart user recommendations, categorize and classify large amounts of data, and who is comfortable performing these tasks on potentially messy and unstructured data sets.  Some or all of the following requirements are key differentiators for this position:
          Data Science:
           Experience designing, writing, optimizing, or debugging algorithms
           Experience with data mining, machine learning, or advanced analytics (e.g. handling large amounts of data, basic statistical techniques, graph theory/social network analysis).
           An understanding of entity extraction solutions and associated natural language processing architectures.
           Experience using map reduce techniques to perform large-scale distributed batch analytics.
          Candidates must be in MD/VA or DC and US Citizens/Green Card Holders
