        Monsanto Biotech is looking for an Analytics Automation Team Lead in its Genomics & Data Science platform to help us transform unprecedented genomics data into higher yielding crops and pest control solutions. Your team will multiply the output of hundreds of scientists by enabling smarter, faster, more data-driven decisions.
        You will work with a group of data scientists and bioinformatics scientists to develop data analysis and predictive analytics infrastructure and practices. You are expected to improve several current existing bioinformatics pipelines into fully automatic processes on the AWS cloud analytics environment.
        The role will require close collaboration with an array of teams and leads, across Biotechnology and IT organizations. You will play a key role in bringing in modern IT technologies and best practices to transform bioinformatics pipelines to tools that are automatically kick off by LIMS systems and provide user friendly reports for project teams to make their decisions. You also need to work with several IT teams to integrate our analytics pipelines to IT enterprise data systems seamlessly.
        Role and responsibilities:
        * Lead a group of computational biologists, data scientists and software developers in developing bioinformatics pipelines and databases, novel algorithms, data integration systems, and user-facing data analytics applications
        * Interact with scientific project teams actively to understand their needs in data science support and provide solutions.
        * Implement a sustainable strategy in pipeline development:
        * Adoption of cloud infrastructure and API-driven interfaces.
        * Adopt and build new technology for genome assembly and comparison, enabling research platforms in gene editing and trait integration.
        * Promote the use of best software practices, including version control, documentation, reusable libraries, and code testing.
        * Work with internal collaborators to strategically identify and meet scientific challenges via data science solutions
        Required Skills:
        * M.S. or Ph.D. in a quantitative or science discipline with 3 years of experience leading people or project teams.
        * Concrete understanding of database and software development practices.
        * Excellent verbal and written communication skills, especially in communicating computational solutions to scientific problems and conclusions from analysis of complex data.
        * Proven skills and experience in definition and implementation of automatic analytical solutions and their application to biotechnology, particularly sequence analysis, plant biology, or microbiology.
        * Facility with a programming language suitable for scientific work or data science, such as R or Python.
        * Facility with Git or another version control system.
        * Demonstrated ability to learn new methods and technologies as necessary to meet objectives.
        * Experience working with Amazon Web Services or other cloud stacks.
        * Experience implementing APIs for a relatively complex system.
        Desired Skills/Experience:
        * Ph.D. in a data-intensive discipline, or equivalent work experience.
        * Genomics or Computational Biology expertise.
        * Experience leading data / computational scientists.
        * Demonstrated experience driving and transforming data analysis and/or computational culture. Strong statistics and/or machine learning skills.
        * Experience working with Amazon Web Services or other cloud stacks.
        * Experience working with noSQL (e.g. CouchDB, MongoDB, Hadoop).
        * Experience creating web services using R or Python.
        * Scientific programming skills in a high performance language (e.g. C, C , Java, Scala, Clojure, Go).
        * Maintainer of at least one open source project, such as an R package (on CRAN, Bioconductor, or Github) or Python library.
        * Experience using high performance computing environments such as SGE, LSF, or AWS.
        * Experience with scientific data visualization.
        * Familiarity with Tibco's Spotfire application and/or R's Shiny package.
