            Data Science Manager - Advertising Product and Platforms
          We are looking for Data Science Managers to join the band and help drive a data-first culture across the advertising business in Spotify.
          As Data Scientists, our mission is to turn terabytes of data into insights and get a deep understanding of how our people use our apps to impact the product, strategy and direction of Spotify. You will study user behavior, strategic initiatives, content, and new features and bring data and insights into every decision we make. Above all, your work will impact the way the world experiences music.
          We are developing a world-class advertising platform to support the free tier of Spotify. Data scientists in this area will be helping to answer questions such as
           How can we innovate the audio advertising format?
           How do we accurately measure ad effectiveness and utilize this information?
           What levers can we use to convert users in the Freemium model?
           How do we optimize to show the right ads to the right users at the right times?
          As a Data Science Manager you’ll be a hands-on leader of a team of 2-6 professionals from the Product Insights team focussed on improving our advertising platform.
          What you’ll do:
           Manage and coach a team of 2-6 high performing data scientists
           Own analysis of large sets of data to extract actionable insights that will help drive product decisions
           Communicate data-driven insights and recommendations to key stakeholders
           Partner with lead user researchers, product owners, designers, and engineers who are passionate about Spotify’s success
           Conduct A/B tests to drive iterative improvement through efficient experimentation
           Build lasting solutions to surface critical data and performance metrics
           Contribute to the development of the Product Insights function and the Analytics Community at Spotify

           You have a deep understanding of numbers, as well as a strong business sense and a desire to coach and train others
           Ideally you have experience working in an analytics role within an advertising function and have conducted A/B tests
           You have the technical competence to perform more advanced analytics:
             Coding skills for analytics and data extraction (SQL, R, Python, Pandas)
             Data visualization (such as Tableau, Qlik, D3, ggplot)
             Experience performing analysis with large datasets
