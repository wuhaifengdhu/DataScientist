        Description:
        Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER) has an opportunity for a satellite data assimilation scientist to support the NOAA-NESDIS activities in cloud-, rain- and ice- impacted radiance data assimilation in operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. Current approaches discard satellite data that are impacted by rain and ice and, to a certain extent, cloud. This screening prevents the current assimilation system from taking advantage of the information content in the satellite measurements in the regions of high importance to forecasts. To mitigate this problem, the Joint Center of Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) is accelerating the development of methods to assimilate cloud/precipitation impacted microwave radiances. The work facility is located in the state-of-the-art NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction (NCWCP) building in College Park, Maryland.
        AER assimilation scientists work in diverse areas including, radiative transfer, sensor simulation, characterization of atmospheric and surface properties from space-based observations, cloud analysis, and more. AER's assimilation work assignments are interesting, challenging, varied, and rewarding. We are seeking self-motivated candidates with abilities to work in a team environment and independently. This project requires specialized experience in physical science, mathematics and computer science in at least some of the following areas: modern data assimilation methods (e.g., variational and Kalman filtering), physically-based remote sensing/ assimilation of satellite data in NWP models (including forward operator error characterization and data quality control), variational retrieval methods. Experience with at least one satellite remote sensing data set is required. An advanced degree in meteorology/atmospheric sciences, applied mathematics, or a similar field is required. Because software and tools developed at the JCSDA are primarily composed of modern FORTRAN, bash scripts, and IDL, proficiency in these are desired.
        AER offers a competitive wage and benefit package. AER is an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. As a federal contractor, AER welcomes priority referrals of protected veterans and individuals with disabilities. Please apply online at https://careers.verisk.com/joblist.html?displaymode=-4.1020.
        Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER) helps businesses and governments better anticipate and manage climate and weather-related risks. Large government agencies like NOAA, NASA and the Departments of Defense and Energy rely on AER's scientists to help solve weather and climate related problems of vital national importance in energy, environment, national security and climate change. Large insurance, energy and investment firms count on AER to help them decrease weather-related losses and increase profitability by integrating state-of-the-art climate science and weather information into their planning and decision processes. Established in 1977, AER is headquartered in Lexington, Massachusetts and is a subsidiary of Verisk Analytics. For more information visit www.aer.com.
