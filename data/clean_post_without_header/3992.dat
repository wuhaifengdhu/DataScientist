        Genia's mission is to make genetic information universally available. Our proprietary integrated circuits and NanoTag chemistry enable massively parallel single-molecule DNA sequencing. This versatile nanopore-based platform allows for single molecule, electrical, real-time analysis without the need for complicated optics, labels or amplification. By developing a true integrated circuit on standard semiconductor technology, Genia's platform enables the use of molecular diagnostics in everyday clinical care. Genia Technologies was founded in March of 2009 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Genia was acquired by Roche in June of 2014.
        The data science group here is not like those at other companies. We generate and process massive amounts of sequencing data on a system designed and built in-house from the ground up. As a Data Scientist at Genia, you will be performing analysis to drive development of our sequencing technology. The successful candidate must be excited about learning new concepts from chemistry, physics, algorithm development and electrical engineering and applying them to an interdisciplinary project. The majority of your time will be spent aggregating, analyzing and summarizing the output of DNA sequencing experiments. You will also be responsible for updating, maintaining and testing portions of our automated analysis pipeline.
        Responsibilities Include:
        * Using command line tools to perform data conversion and analysis
        * Supporting other team members in retrieving and archiving experimental results
        * Quickly writing scripts to automate routine analysis tasks
        * Creating insightful, simple graphics to represent complex trends
        * Who you are
        You're someone who wants to influence your own development. You're looking for a company where you have the opportunity to pursue your interests across functions and geographies. Where a job title is not considered the final definition of who you are, but the starting point.
        Skills
        * MUST have scientific programming experience (Matlab, R, Python, etc.); familiarity with numpy and the Python scientific stack is a strong plus
        * Demonstrated ability to track and work with 100s-1000s of files and GB-TB of data
        * Need to be comfortable working in a Unix environment,
        * Basic understanding of analog electronic circuits is a plus
        * Chemistry or biophysics background is a plus
        Background
        * BS or MS in computer science, physics, electrical engineering or similar
        * Experience working on a long-term, lab-based project (academic experience acceptable)
        * Who we are
        At Roche, 91,700 people across 100 countries are pushing back the frontiers of healthcare. Working together, we've become one of the world's leading research-focused healthcare groups. Our success is built on innovation, curiosity and diversity.
