        Description:
        Senior Data Scientist, Orlando FL
        Data is an abundant and accessible unrefined resource. In Leidos Engineering, we use the latest machine learning technologies, tools, and techniques to refine that data to a capital asset for our Smart City utility, transportation and manufacturing partners. Our partners rely on that derived capital to economically meet the needs of their customers while striking a balance with the needs of the environment.
        We are seeking a full-time Senior Data Scientist in Orlando, FL, who is excited to fulfill this vision to maintain the balance of environment and economy. That same data scientist is undaunted at coding challenges and has a deep drive to finding that impactful insight from data to sustain the vision.
        The candidate shall work with other data scientists to creatively construct data science solutions to a problem with the data on hand. That data scientist may meet marketing, sales, customer facing representatives or directly with customers to understand their problems and needs. The data scientist shall then apply the latest machine learning tools available to create impactful insight addressing these customer needs. The data scientist shall then persuasively propose a solution including visualization. If the solution requires Big Data processing, the data scientist may also work to instantiate that Big Data solution.
