        MailChimp is the world's leading email marketing service. More than 15 million people and businesses use MailChimp to design and send 1 billion emails a day. We empower small businesses with a suite of powerful and easy-to-use email, marketing automation, and analytics tools that integrate with hundreds of popular applications and services.
        The Data Science team builds applications that make sense of the data created by MailChimp's millions of users. By using predictive analytics and big data technologies we help MailChimp fight spam and empower small businesses with information. We work closely with MailChimp's Development and Operations teams to make analytical insights actionable within our infrastructure.
        MailChimp is looking for a Data Scientist to help our data science team's research efforts. You'll work alongside software engineers by trialing analyses and training predictive models on our data that will eventually become internal services. You'll touch hundreds of terabytes of data along the way in all manner of datastores: MySQL, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Redis and more.
        The ideal candidate is a self-directed, experienced data scientist who believes in demonstrating how data can be used to help our customers. You're not necessarily an expert programmer, but you know your way around an editor or command shell. You love new challenges, but you're skeptical of the new hotness. You've run analyses using various tools, but you're partial to Python. Communication and cross-validation are tools you use every day.
