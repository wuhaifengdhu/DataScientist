          Translational Development at Celgene
          A role of Translational Development at Celgene is to provide disease specific patient selection strategies, insights into target engagement and downstream phenotypic effects to guide and support early phase development programs and late clinical development programs in solid tumors including but not limited to GBM, Lung and Pancreatic Cancer.  Development of deeper understanding of the biology, pathophysiology, oncogenic, microenvironment and immunological influencers in these disease states to empower existing and future Celgene assets.
          Translational development is a central theme of many pipeline and acquired assets at Celgene. The position holder will be expected to develop a large matrix of internal and external stakeholders across relevant diseases and drug MOAs. At the moment the drug assets span IO, epigenetics and protein homeostasis but since we have a highly active process of external innovation and partnership the incumbent must demonstrate the ability and willingness to pick up new areas of basic and applied science as required.
            Position Description:
          •Leads translational disease team with deep disease, drug development and business knowledge in solid tumors.
          •Leads and oversees execution of strategy on all components of translational development approach in disease area including but not limited to various aspects of patient selection strategies in solid tumors and translational research
          •Liaises with key Celgene Research and Early Development thematic centers of excellence areas including protein homeostasis, immune-oncology, bio-therapeutics and epigenetics and companion diagnostics group to help formulate and execute on   new hypotheses driving new clinical biomarker assays for unmet need segments, disease strategy for new targets and development candidates and ensure seamless transition of patient selection strategies beyond Phase 1
          •Liaises with late clinical development program to support late clinical R and D and MAST projects
          •Supports regulatory and communication needs of late phase compounds and approved drugs for the disease area
          •Identifies needs, gaps and translational questions and applies knowledge across all disease programs and assets in Celgene portfolio and combinations with external assets
