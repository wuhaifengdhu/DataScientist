        Cerner Math is a new, innovative group focusing on developing data-driven business and mathematical model-based solutions for the health industry, positioning Cerner as the world's largest health informatics properties mediating petabyte-scale health data. Cerner Math and the Innovations Development group is an established, fast growing company/group with minimal hierarchy and an entrepreneurial spirit. We seek the best and brightest talent to join the team â€“ individuals who thrive on analytical problem solving and data-driven analysis who are smart, ambitious, and inquisitive. As a member of the Cerner Math team, you will, focus on utilizing a unique blend of top-tier Big Data platform architecture, data-driven analytics, and health-related mathematical modeling. You will build Cerner's mathematical model assets and development capabilities to extract and analyze data at national scale, driving insights and real-time expert systems for our clients that impact their most strategic business decisions. You will be challenged to navigate structured and unstructured data, from engineering its extraction to performing statistical analysis to deriving valuable mathematical predictive model assets. As part of a core technical team of creative VLDB software experts and mathematicians and statisticians working with some of the most innovative data platforms, you will drive the discovery of and engineer data-driven executable knowledge. You will work on the cutting edge of Big Data where data management stacks have had to evolve beyond traditional data warehousing and business intelligence capabilities. You will develop critical mathematical-model-based embedded systems that drive high-value business actions for our health industry clients.
        Responsibilities include:
        * Design and develop analysis systems to extract meaning from large scale structured and unstructured health data
        * Discover explanatory variables in high-dimensionality collections of data that relate to clinically, financially, and/or operationally important use-cases
        * Perform dimensionality-reduction and design and develop mathematical models and predictive statistical models in the lower-dimension space
        * Rapidly implement prototypes of actionable decision support systems
        * Contribute to patent applications and other intellectual property pertinent to the model and system assets
        * Devise validation testing mechanisms and knowledge-transfer to other teams responsible for client use-cases and deployment
