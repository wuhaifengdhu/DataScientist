If you like the idea of matching wits and building solutions with the best and brightest in social media and advertising—Facebook, Google, P&G or Chrysler—this is the right place for you. We are grounded in the needs of our end customers and make decisions that will help make the product more valuable to them.
           Job Responsibilities:
         As a Product Manager you will engage with a very smart, cross-disciplinary team to conceive, design and implement the ODC measurement strategy from day one, covering all bases from product workflows, new product features, methodologies and new deliverables. You will ensure our needs are being met across our tech, analytics and publisher partners, with best-in-class results being generated for our internal sales teams and Measurement customers. You are responsible for defining the priorities and optimizing your roadmap for the biggest wins. You must be responsive, flexible and able to succeed in an open collaborative peer environment. Fundamentally, you will be responsible for ensuring that new ODC measurement products mirror our leadership in addressable media measurement.

         3.      Data visualization is a pet peeve, or at least something that bothers you when it’s done poorly, but you don’t think of yourself as a full-fledged data scientist
         4.      You are never happy with your product – making customers happy with what the product does, and delighting them in ways they could not conceive is what drives you
         5.      You love working in teams – have the ability to work with designers, developers and business leaders to generate buy in for the product direction you are setting
