        Job Description:
        JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is a leading global financial services firm with assets of $2.6 trillion and operations worldwide. The firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, and asset management. We serve millions of consumers in the United States and many of the world's most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients under our J.P. Morgan and Chase brands. Information about JPMorgan Chase & Co. is available at www.jpmorganchase.com.
        Chase Consumer & Community Banking serves nearly 66 million consumers and 4 million small businesses with a broad range of financial services, including personal banking, investment advice, small business lending, mortgages, credit cards, payments and auto financing. In recent years, we have undertaken a large-scale digital transformation initiative, building on the success of our current mobile and online service offerings. The Digital team is responsible for building innovative platforms and developing new products that make banking and payment tasks simpler and more personalized for our customers, as well as deepen customer engagement and loyalty with more relevant offers and services. The ambition is to position Chase as the undisputed leader in digital financial services and payments, and to enable highly personalized, real-time experiences that customers increasingly expect. We function similar to a fintech start-up in our brand new offices that inspire collaboration, transparency, agile development, and a fun working environment.
        The Digital Intelligence team's mission is to deeply personalize the digital experience of our millions of customers through the use of the firm's massive datasets, AI/machine learning algorithms and proprietary data platforms. Whether it's building a financial graph of consumers and small businesses, optimizing ad targeting on chase.com/mobile and paid media sites, recommending the most relevant hotels or gift cards or merchant offers, or detecting fraudulent behavior, we work at the intersection of statistics, machine learning and engineering to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting problems you will find in banking, commerce and payment. Many companies claim that they work on "big data" and "data science". We live and breathe every day.
        We are currently looking for a data scientist that has extensive theoretical and practical experience implementing graph models at a big data scale. You will be analyzing our rich data sources (billions of records) for useful patterns and insights. Published research on this topic will be highly desirable for this role. Our ideal candidate loves both machine learning and engineering tasks without needing an army of engineers, and loves learning new skills along the way. You will be joining one of the most elite data science teams we have assembled in banking and payments - several of us have worked at Internet and start-up companies before joining the team. You will work with the latest Hadoop/Spark stack, and will enjoy working with colleagues who are just as passionate and curious as you are.
