             ** located in Metrotech Brooklyn, long term Contract
             Job Description:
            We're looking for visual designers who specialize in Information and Interaction Design. The appropriate candidate loves making sense of complex things (whether information, data, controls or even conceptual in nature) with the intention of reframing it into something simple, elegant, and actionable. You'll enjoy asking tough questions to help deconstruct the problem and mine for insights. And in general, you'll love producing high quality, clever, designs that elegantly solve the problem and not surprisingly delight the users. Ideal candidates are part inventor, part craftsman but most of all, makers.
            We sit within a Product Management organization and so we are serious creating tools and services that improve peoples' lives (at work) and achieve clear business goals. Our users have complex, fast-paced, informationally overloaded jobs (within an already complex industry) and so their tools must provide benefits without adding to it. As a UX team, we have to 'go deep' into the problem-space drawing from the various techniques designers have for finding insights that others can't. And, as with any successful product or service, our designs solve users' problems but also guide a product's evolution into a powerful and extensible framework.
            Operating similar to an internal agency, we'll take on a good variety of business-critical projects where design is a necessary part of the solution. In the New Product Development group, our role is to drive an agenda of innovation by helping to identify and evolve the best ideas by partnering up with our skilled team of data scientists, engineers, and business owners to figure out the best path to success.

           •   Take an active role in the quality assurance throughout development and deployment
           •   Actively support efforts to codify preferred and industry-appropriate design standards
