           Director of Product, Capital One Labs
            Who we are:
           Money is the central enabler for daily life – so why has the way we interact with our money remained relatively static?
           While other industries have undergone major transformation, dramatic change in the financial services industry is decades overdue. Capital One is on a journey to bring ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity back to banking. Money is never just digits on a screen to us – it’s someone’s groceries, first car, new home, or plane tickets home for the holidays. We measure our success by our customer’s success. In short, we’re on a quest to change banking for good.
           That quest to change banking for good shows up across our business, and we’re making real time improvements that positively shape our customer’s financial health. As a company, we’re looking beyond today, and innovating for the future. Entrepreneurship is deeply ingrained in the DNA of our company – stemming from our founder, CEO, and Chairman of the Board – Richard Fairbank.
           Founded in 2011, Capital One Labs is the company’s experimental product & technology incubator and accelerator. It’s a startup culture with the financial backing of a Fortune 200 company. With teams in SF, NYC, and DC, Labs is a cross-functional team of product managers, designers, data scientists, developers, and other innovators who are committed to do the following:
            Inspire, explore, enable, and deliver.
            Redefine how people interact with their money.
           We do this by looking 2-3 years into the future to identify high impact opportunities, and then we set out to develop and deliver new and impactful solutions that help customers and Capital One succeed. In the last 5 years, we’ve accumulated volumes of world class consumer research, delivered several best-in-class products to market, scaled products in the business, and put building blocks in place that have helped to shape company strategy…and we’re just getting started.
