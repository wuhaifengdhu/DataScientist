        Netflix is revolutionizing entertainment. We deliver over a billion hours of movies and TV shows per month to more than 93 million members globally. Our data-driven culture allows us to continuously innovate and provide the best experience for our members. We are at the forefront of using advanced mathematical models and algorithms on big data to personalize the experience that every member has, and our scientists and engineers are constantly looking for new ways to improve the state of the art. Netflix data science is a unique combination of big data, algorithms, and entertainment: where else do you get to work on big data and win fourteen Emmys (four for technical achievement), two Golden Globes, and earn back to back Oscar nominations!
        Netflix maintains a relentless focus on experimentation in order to improve the experience for our members. The Streaming Science and Algorithms team partners with engineering teams to develop and test new approaches and algorithms to improve the streaming Quality of Experience (QoE). These algorithms have a direct impact on the viewing experience as they determine key aspects of the experience such as video quality, delay before playback starts, and ensuring an uninterrupted playback session. Check out the following posts to learn more about the team and some of the problems we're working on:
        Optimizing the Netflix Streaming Experience with Data Science
        Turning Data into a Better Viewing Experience
        Optimizing Content Quality Control at Netflix with Predictive Modeling
        In this role, you will have the opportunity to optimize the Netflix streaming experience by designing experiments to evaluate changes to our streaming-related algorithms, and use rigorous statistical modeling and analysis to discover critical insights that shape the product experience for millions of Netflix subscribers around the world. The streaming QoE space is still nascent and as part of our team, you will have the opportunity to do groundbreaking modeling and experimental work that will shape the industry.
