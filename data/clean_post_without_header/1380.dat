          At Civis we’re looking for great software engineers with particular expertise in front end development.  Our Front End Engineers are responsible for the user interfaces and visualizations of our data science products and can often be found working on our highest velocity projects. We rely on front end engineers to combine science, beauty and function to ensure a clean user experience.
          What's great about being a Front End engineer at Civis? We believe in ownership of our work and continuous learning, and we run our team to reinforce those values.
          We trust engineers from all over our team to pick the right architecture, library, or framework for the job at hand. They help make decisions about new products in cross-functional design sprints and take quarterly hack weeks to try out new ideas and new technologies. Civis engineers push code to production on their second day and from there work on projects chosen to gain more and more responsibility right away.
          We want to never stop learning. Everyone has a mentor from day one and tracks their personal development alongside their technical deliverables. We staff projects based on what people will learn, not just who knows it best today. Engineers collaborate across departments with our data scientists and analysts who are not only the best and brightest in their fields, but are also eager to teach and learn from you. Finally, valuing continuous learning also means recognizing that our strongest contributors stand out for their capabilities and not their credentials.
          We are smart, fun, and a little bit weird. Does this sound like you?
