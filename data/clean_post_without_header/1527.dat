        Description
        The primary function of the RQS Business Platforms group is to imagine, design and implement the key capabilities needed to enable AbbVie to have an industry leading technology-enabled Regulatory, Quality and Safety business function. Critical to that mission is building a data science capability that allows RQS to quickly develop accurate insights from evolving, complex data sets. We have an exciting opportunity available for a Senior Data Scientist within Information Research (IR) to leverage and extend our data science capabilities in the Pharmacovigilance and Patient Safety (PPS) space. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in computer science with both data architecture and manipulation/visualization skills as well as statistical modeling skills. The candidate will work with senior scientists, physicians and technology groups to generate data-driven insights related to the safety of our products. The candidate will work with large internal (e.g. PV safety data) and external (e.g. FDA, RWE data) data sets and a suite of analytical / programming tools to generate deep insights for the PPS group.
        Key Responsibilities
        * Design – understand key analytical challenges in the area of pharmacovigilance and work with senior scientists / physicians to structure analytical approaches to answer questions of interest. Dynamically design algorithms to address scientific queries.
        * Build – through your own efforts or by working with software engineers develop custom software solutions / processes that contribute to and help foster the growing AbbVie data integration environment. Leverage existing tool sets (R, Spotfire, D3, JQuery, Apex, .NET, JReview, etc) to develop data visualizations and recommend new tools that would benefit AbbVie.
        * Presentation –bring together disparate data types in compelling visualization packages that provide end users with the ability to see both 'the landscape' and details leading to improved decision-making
        * Database Support – have the necessary skills to design and develop ETLs and materialized views, possess technical proficiencies in relational database technologies to create physical data models.
        * Transactional System Support – integrate and generate data reports on existing custom and vendor systems
        * Collaboration– candidate will link PPS stakeholders with IR teams to solve data problems in a simple and agile manner
        * Adaptability – given our diverse mission you should be able to move fluidly between different project responsibilities
        Qualifications
        * MS in Computer Science or related field with 10 years of experience in data science; Doctorate preferred.
        * Proven ability to develop solutions in scientific programming languages (e.g. Java, C#, UNIX Shell Script, Python, R)
        * Ability to develop web services (e.g. REST based APIs using J2EE and/or Spring)
        * Working experience in cloud computing services implementation (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud)
        * Expert-Level Oracle skills -- including SQL, PL/SQL, Oracle triggers, and JDBC programming
        * Experience in data modeling/integration and RDBMS (Oracle DB, SQL Server)
        * Familiarity with big data ecosystems (Hadoop, Hive, Pig) and NoSQL (MongoDB) a plus
        * Experience with UNIX scripting
        * Familiarity with tools and techniques for data analysis, harmonization, and visualization (e.g. Pipeline Pilot, Spotfire, Seurat)
        * Ability to effectively communicate, both verbally and in writing to scientists and non-scientists
        * Ability to manage a multiple projects with multiple teams and collaborations
