        This position is responsible for designing and maintaining highly scalable data management systems, building high-performance algorithms, prototypes and predictive models, as well as creating customer software components by employing a variety of programming languages and off-the-shelf tools to marry system together. In his/her role, the data engineer will work closely with data architects to determine what data management systems are appropriate and data scientists to determine which data are needed for analysis. This position will work with stakeholders to understand their information needs and translate these into technical solutions using such tools as Spark, Hbase, Hive, NiFi, Python and R. This position will work intimately with existing team of Data Science staff to take existing or new/prototype models and convert them into scalable analytical solutions.
        More specifically, the responsibilities include:
        * Translating complex functional and technical requirements into detailed architecture, design, and high
        * performing software.
        * Leading Big Data analytical solutions leveraging transformational technologies.
        * Driving user ideation analysis and elaboration, design and development of software applications, testing, and builds automation tools.
        * Selecting data solution software and defining hardware requirements.
        * Translating business requirements into system requirements.
        * Building next-generation Big Data analytics framework developed on a group of core
        * technology.
        * Coding, testing, and documenting new or modified data systems to create robust and scalable applications for data analytics.
        * Ensuring all automated processes preserve data by managing the alignment of data availability and integration processes.
        * Collaborating with data architects, modelers and IT team members on project goals.
        * Assisting with extracting standard sets of features from important datasets that will be leveraged by Data Science team.
        * Translating code from native R and Python applications into Spark applications.
        * Design and implement big data analytics models and solutions, as well as integrate new data management technologies and software engineering tools into existing structures
        * Research opportunities for data acquisition and new uses for existing data, and develop data set processes for data modeling, mining and production
        * Serve as consultant to data scientists, data architect and business project leads, and interprets data results to business customers.
        * Develops standards and governance processes for integration projects and initiatives.
