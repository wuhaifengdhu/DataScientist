        Produce more. Conserve more. Improve lives. This is Monsanto's vision to feed the world's growing population. Advanced statistical modeling and data analytics are central to attaining this vision.
        We are seeking an exceptionally talented individual with a passion for innovation to become an integral part of our Global Analytics Team within the Breeding Organization. The global analytics team is a cutting-edge group of data scientists and geneticists that utilize big data to develop predictive breeding models and optimization solutions to accelerate Monsanto's hybrid and varietal product development around the globe. As part of our diverse, highly dynamic group, you will be exposed to exciting quantitative genetics and big data challenges and will work closely with interdisciplinary scientists – geneticists, breeders, data scientists, mathematicians, computer scientists, software developers, and engineers. These interactions will foster your career growth and development while delivering next-generation scientific breakthroughs.
        In this role you are required to use advanced quantitative analyses, data mining techniques and strong business acumen to deliver insight and recommendations for breeding pipeline and business decisions. You are required to solve complex problems with tera/peta bytes of genotypic and phenotypic data using the latest innovations in genomic selection, machine learning, predictive analytics and optimization algorithms. You will design and test algorithms and conduct prototyping to evaluate possible scenarios leveraging computational and mathematical techniques to develop novel approaches for high-throughput data analyses. You will provide value added business recommendations and solutions based on innovations and insights from data. You will present compelling, validated data solutions to all levels of organization, including peers, senior management and internal customers to drive both strategic and operational changes in business.
        Required Skills:
        * PhD or PhD completion in the next 6 months – plant or animal breeding, statistical genetics, statistics, data science, biostatistics or mathematics or closely related field.
        * Creative, proactive, bold and out-of-box thinking.
        * Proficient in either machine learning algorithms and concepts (ensembles, deep learning, SVM, etc.) or advanced breeding and genomic selection concepts and models (gBLUP, GWAS, nonlinear models and longitudinal data, Bayesian methods, etc.).
        * Experience and passion for solving analytical problems involving big data sets using quantitative approaches.
        * Demonstrate computational skills and experience with R or other statistical & mathematical programming packages.
        * Strong publication record in leading scientific journals
        * Strong organizational, interpersonal, and proven problem solving abilities.
        * Ability to work in a matrix environment, leading and influencing people at varying levels of responsibility
        * Proven ability to communicate complex qualitative analysis in clear, precise and actionable manner.
        Desired Skills:
        * Cloud operation experience – running real workloads in the cloud and diagnosing and fixing problems (AWS preferred).
        * 2 years of Scala experience.
        * Experience with simulation and optimization algorithms is highly desired.
