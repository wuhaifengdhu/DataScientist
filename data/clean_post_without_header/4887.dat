        Job Description
        The Biomedical Informatics Department, at Emory University, is looking for a Research
        Scientist in Big Data Management and Integration. You will be responsible for
        researching and developing data engineering solutions to integrate and federate data
        from various sources of cancer research in the Internet scale. As a member of our
        research group you will be expected to design, implement, and deploy distributed
        systems to manage data of heterogeneous nature, storage, and communication. We are
        looking for someone with a solid understanding and experience on distributed systems
        and cloud computing and is interested in learning and applying cutting edge technologies
        for the challenges of performance and scale. The ideal candidate would be an
        independent, yet a team player with keen interest to collaborating and coordinating with
        the team working on the data sciences research.
        This work is part of a large NIH-funded project. What this means is that you will help
        develop an exciting piece of technology that will be part of a national infrastructure
        supporting cancer research â€” one that brings together disparate cancer datasets and
        gives the research community the ability to examine data like never before. Your work
        will have direct impact on cancer research and will become widely known through
        national and international adoption, collaborative participation in large-scale projects and
        open source software efforts, and most importantly, in advancing healthcare.
        The ideal candidate is one who is motivated by challenging applications and is interested
        in exploring how advances in distributed computing and cloud computing can benefit
        healthcare. We collaborate extensively with well-known research groups from prominent
        institutions, and draw upon the first rate technical and scientific resources available at
        Emory and Georgia Tech.
        Qualifications
        You will be primarily developing server side applications using Java and a variety of
        open-source big data frameworks such as Apache Drill and Hadoop. You will build upon
        a suite of existing systems that have been built in our lab and help add new functionality
        and increase the scale of storage, complexity of data, and the variety of data types.
        Required:
        * PhD in Computer Science or Computer Engineering with an emphasis on Distributed
        Computing/Cloud Computing/HPC.
        * Expert in developing enterprise applications with Java, with experience in concurrent
        computing and streams.
        * Experienced in distributed systems principles execution frameworks such as
        Hazelcast and Infinispan, and distributed storage and processing frameworks such
        as Apache Hadoop.
        * Working knowledge of SQL and NoSQL databases.
        * Comfortable with public and private cloud deployments, including the Amazon web
        services (AWS).
        * Experienced in web services engines and development of RESTful APIs and web
        services.
        * Experienced in various architectures and paradigms such as SOA and OSGi.
        * Unit and integration testing, version control (Git), and project management tools like
        Maven
        * Track record of presenting at premier conferences and publishing in relevant journals.
