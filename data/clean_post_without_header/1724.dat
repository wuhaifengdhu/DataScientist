          Have a passion for automation, building high performance technology and sweating the details? At Civis Analytics, we're building a data science platform, making cutting-edge machine learning and predictive modeling techniques available to a broad audience. Come help us deliver these capabilities at scale with modern, first-class infrastructure.
          As a devops engineer, you'll be responsible for enhancing our underlying systems architecture, development environment, and release processes. We have a cutting-edge AWS configuration and we like to move fast using continuous deployment.
          If you know how to make code deployment fast, easy and safe, we want to talk to you. If you think you can help us deliver scalable analytics computing in the cloud, not just for ourselves but for our whole client base, we want to talk to you.
          We are looking for individuals from a wide range of backgrounds with demonstrated quantitative and problem-solving skills. We value creativity, hard work and on-the-job-excellence and offer competitive compensation and benefits packages. In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify their identity and eligibility to work in the United States.
          What's great about being an engineer at Civis Analytics?
          Your code will make the world a better place. Our engineers don’t just experience the thrill of solving interesting problems, they also have the satisfaction of knowing that their work makes a difference in the world. We don’t shy away from helping companies beef up their bottom line, but we also devote significant resources to projects that do good.
          You will learn. Our engineers, data scientists and analysts are not only the best and brightest in their fields, but are also eager to teach and learn from you. We send our engineers to conferences and workshops they're interested in. Need software, a book, or AWS instance to help you with your work? Consider it done.
          Your work will be diverse. It is not like we have just one or two problems we're trying to solve over here. Every day we're learning and working on new, cutting edge problems at the intersection of technology, data science, and practical application. Engineers at Civis have the opportunity to move around from problem to problem.
          We trust our engineers. One of the perks of working with the best and brightest is that you're given the trust you deserve. Are you interested in pursuing a new way of solving an old problem? Nice -- give it a shot. Yes, you will still have a manager and deliverable, but we make a point of giving creativity the room and respect it deserves.
          Your voice can change the direction of a project. We strongly encourage our engineers to participate in the brainstorming and prioritization process. We don't want people that mindlessly program. We want your perspective and experience. Challenge our assumptions, make us rethink our strategy, and help us improve our solutions. Your expertise will be a critical part of our success and you'll be recognized for your contributions.
          We are smart, fun, and a little bit weird. Does this sound like you?
