          About
         AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. was founded in 1998 to provide property and casualty insurance to small businesses. Through acquisitions and organic growth, AmTrust Financial Services has since grown to become a multinational property and casualty insurer specializing in coverage for small to mid-sized businesses. Our financial stability is based upon a philosophy of niche diversity with a focus on low-hazard risk.
         Since its inception, AmTrust has crafted a balanced portfolio of insurance products including:
          Multiline Small Business Insurance
          Warranty and Specialty Risk Insurance
          Specialty Program Business Insurance
         We are currently in the process of building a Data Science/Predictive Analytics division within AmTrust from the ground up. Given the unique nature of this start-up, the visibility and opportunites are endless.
