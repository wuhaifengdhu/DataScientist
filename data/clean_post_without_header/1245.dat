          At Wunderman, we believe that great communication doesn't just help brands perform better, it helps consumers get what they really want. And that makes the world a better place for all of us.
          Content has never been so plentiful, and consumer attention has never been in such short supply. But we believe that brands can still inspire people through imaginative experiences. Experiences to identify with, experiences to embrace, experiences to take with them. And that's what we help brands do every day.
          We are Wunderman. We believe in a better future. And we’re looking for a
           Content Strategist
          to help us build it.
           About the Role:
          The Content Strategist will be responsible for the development of the client’s
          content strategy through identifying category opportunities and consumer insights that will develop and deploy multiple forms of content across multiple brands. You will support and
          collaborate with creative to develop concepts and storytelling approaches and
          ensure that the implementation of the program is consistent with best practices (including ensuring the right level of support is being provided for analytics and SEO optimization before and during the program)
          .
           Responsibilities:
           Drive opens and click-throughs with compelling subject lines and smart, succinct copy

           Identify and prioritize content requirements and deliverables
           Audit existing content to understand current landscape and make solid recommendations (in another scenario, this would include gap analysis and potentially comparative analysis, but here at Best Buy, the audit was used to support a new direction for the Day 3 emails, to dive in and understand the Geek Squad brand, and is also used by me regularly to research products)
           Develop and maintain close collaboration/partnership with the client(s) for whom the solution is being designed
           Collaborate closely with UX architect to develop new approaches and solutions

           Help clients establish writing and editorial standards
           5-6 years of experience in digital content marketing (both “always on” social presence, campaigns, and websites)
           Preferred experience in content and media publishing
