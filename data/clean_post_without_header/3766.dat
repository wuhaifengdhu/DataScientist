        Intuit is seeking a Data Scientist to join our Innovation and Advanced Technology Group in Mountain View, CA.
        The Innovation team develops minimum viable products and experiments that form our pipeline of potential new businesses. You'll be building and prototyping algorithms and applications on top of the collective financial data of 60 million consumers and small businesses. Applications will span multiple business lines, including personal finance, small business accounting, and tax.
        You thrive on ambiguity and enjoy the frequent pivoting that's part of the exploration. Your team will be very small – no bigger than two pizzas can feed – and team members frequently wear multiple hats.
        The position involves close collaboration with the Innovation & Advanced Technology Group's engineering and design teams, as well as the product and data teams in business units. This role ranges from consultative business facilitator, leading discussions, to research experimentalist to technology innovator. The individual must be comfortable partnering with those directly involved with big data infrastructure, software, and data warehousing, as well as product management driving the business.
        In this role, you'll
        * Perform hands-on data analysis and modeling with huge data sets.
        * Apply data mining, NLP and machine learning (both supervised and unsupervised) to improve our relevance and personalization algorithms
        * Work side-by-side with product managers, software engineers, and designers in designing experiments and minimum viable products
        * Discover data sources, get access to them, import them, clean them up, and make them "model-ready". You need to be willing and able to do your own ETL.
        * Create and refine features from the underlying data. You'll enjoy developing just enough subject matter expertise to have an intuition about what features might make your model perform better, and then you'll lather, rinse and repeat.
        * Run regular A/B tests, gather data, perform statistical analysis, draw conclusions on the impact of your optimizations and communicate results to peers and leaders
        * BS, MS, or PhD in an appropriate technology field (Computer Science, Statistics, Applied Math, Econometrics, Operations Research).
        * 5 years experience with data science and/or software engineering.
        * Expertise in modern advanced analytical tools and programming languages such as R or Python with scikit-learn.
        * Expertise in data mining algorithms and statistical modeling techniques such as clustering, classification, regression, decision trees, neural nets, support vector machines, genetic algorithms, anomaly detection, recommender systems, sequential pattern discovery, and text mining.
        * Solid communication skills: Demonstrated ability to explain complex technical issues to both technical and non-technical audiences
        Preferred Additional Experience
        * Large-scale graph algorithms, clustering, page-rank, and community detection.
        * Hadoop, HDFS, Hive, HBase, MapReduce, and Mahout.
        * Apache Spark, SparkSQL, MLlib, and Scala Actors.
        * Ensemble Methods, Deep Learning, and other trendy topics in the Machine Learning community.
