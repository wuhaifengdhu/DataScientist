         Located in Boston and the surrounding communities, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute brings together world renowned clinicians, innovative researchers and dedicated professionals, allies in the common mission of conquering cancer, HIV/AIDS and related diseases. Combining extremely talented people with the best technologies in a genuinely positive environment, we provide compassionate and comprehensive care to patients of all ages; we conduct research that advances treatment; we educate tomorrow's physician/researchers; we reach out to underserved members of our community; and we work with amazing partners, including other Harvard Medical School-affiliated hospitals.
         We are seeking highly motivated and enthusiastic computational individuals who will work within an interdisciplinary team comprising computational scientists, data scientists, bioinformaticians, physicians, and biomedical scientists on immune-related projects in cancer. We are currently seeking a Computational Biologist with formal background in computer science, mathematics, physics, or statistics (with experience in machine learning) to focus on a joint effort in developing novel immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer treatment. The primary focus of the position will be development of robust immunogenomic tools for analyzing high-throughput data from patients, particularly from next-generation sequencing,
         Projects may include:
          Algorithm and software development for accurate characterization of polymorphic, immune-related genomic loci
          Expansion of existing computational capabilities antigen discovery
          Creation of pipelines for interpreting data from single-cell RNA-Seq experiments
          Computational and statistical analysis of cancer genome and transcriptome sequencing studies
         Critical computational contributions will include careful statistical analysis of genomic alterations and their associations with each other and with clinical parameters, development and application of state-of-the-art machine learning and classification tools to carefully identify patterns in complex data, extracting robust signals from noisy experimental data, and the development of production-grade software to facilitate systematic analysis and future discoveries. The ideal candidate will have extensive training in statistics and/or machine learning techniques, with prior experience in building efficient software tools. Immunology knowledge is a plus. Must thrive in an academic/professional atmosphere, where interdisciplinary teams are central to project success.
         SKILLS / TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE / CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: Highly motivated and skilled individuals with a Ph.D. or Master's degree in mathematics, physics, computer science or engineering or comparable research experience. Ability to apply statistical and machine learning techniques to solve “big data” problems. Experience developing algorithms and proficiency in coding (C/C++, Python, JAVA, Scala or equivalent). Significant experience in data analysis languages/environments (MATLAB, R or equivalent) with a desire to focus on applications in computational biology. Ability to work in a highly collaborative and intellectually challenging environment, including excellent oral and written communication skills, to conduct both self-directed and guided computational research.
