        Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI) designs and manufactures semiconductor products and solutions. We enable our customers to interpret the world around us by intelligently bridging the physical and digital worlds with unmatched technologies that sense, measure and connect.
        Job Title: Solution Architect, Condition-based Monitoring Group (CMG)
        Reports to: Technical Lead, CMG
        Analog Devices is a world leader in the measurement of real-world signals for challenging applications and interpretation of these measurements, which is enabling the Internet of Things (IoT). One focus of our IoT strategy is Condition-based Monitoring for machine health applications. The newly formed Condition Monitoring Group combines sensors, precision signal processing and other hardware with data analytics models, diagnostic tools, and a Cloud-based infrastructure to provide early indication of defects, preventing unexpected failures directly impacting productivity in industrial environments.
        This team is chartered with developing the fully integrated end-2-end solution, spanning everything from hardware platforms, distributed firmware, algorithms and a Cloud-based infrastructure.
        Underlying a successful condition monitoring solution includes:
        * Knowing what to "listen" for, or what characteristics to observe
        * How to interpret these findings
        * When to put this knowledge to use and present in a digestible form
        * How to iterate, and improve the learning that offer greater value
        We're looking for an experienced Solutions Architect to join the team and be part of this exciting opportunity for Analog Devices.
        This role suits both application engineer or systems architect with experience in building systems from hardware on the edge all the way up to processing in the cloud. Domain knowledge for this role is essential and a deep understanding of machine health issues such as gearbox and transmission fault evolution, machine diagnostics, bearing failures, rotor and track imbalance is a plus. In addition awareness on performance, application on vibration, acoustic sensors, current and voltage based sensor technologies is important. The ideal candidate will bring a comprehensive understand of the relationship between motor specification and failure mechanism, methods to diagnose failure mechanisms using vibrations and other sensor technologies.
        The opportunity:
        You will provide insight into end to end system design including customer experience, embedded systems and solutions to provide higher levels predictive maintenance. Using precision sensing, signal processing and data analytics that give fuel the diagnostics and prognostics of instrumented machines. You will get the full experience at running end-to-end systems at scale with a global basis footprint. In this role you will get to alongside ADI system architecture, ADI algorithm engineers, data scientists and software development teams to deliver the complete solution.
        Key responsibilities include:
        * Translate market requirements for multiple product iterations
        * Provide motivation for architecture decisions, covering aspects from mechanical housing and fixtures, to robust wireless communications, data storage and security that can scale to a global solution.
        * Collaborate with members of the team to define system interfaces and protocols for a cloud based solution.
        * Develop written engineering requirements for sensor designs and application guidelines for systems and solutions with respect to their specific application.
        * Provide guidance on features and indicators that represent the onset of machine degradation
        * Provide insight to visualisation and customer experience
        * Influence the roadmap for targeted industries, emerging markets and technologies
        * Key customer liaison
        What you need to join the team
        * MSc or higher degree in engineering electrical or mechanical, mathematics, or Computer Science
        * Minimum +6yrs related experience with in motors and drive systems design.
        * You have a several years proven experience which may include Cat III certification or equivalent with machinery vibration analysis
        * You have working knowledge and experience with predictive maintenance technologies and practices including electrical and mechanical infrared inspections, in-place dynamic balancing, airborne ultrasound inspections, and machinery alignment, online and off line motor current analysis.
        * Experience in building large scale end-to-end systems from the edge to the cloud.
        * Ability to grasp the complexity of a multi-disciplinary system, and articulate into component design requirements.
