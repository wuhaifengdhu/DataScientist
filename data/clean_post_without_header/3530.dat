          Role Description
          6sense is a Predictive Intelligence Engine that is reimagining how B2B companies do sales and marketing. We work with big data at scale, advanced machine learning and predictive modeling to find buyers and predict what they will purchase, when and how much.
          The data science team is the core of 6sense engineering. The drive of our visionary CEO and the quality of our work has lead to unprecedented partnerships with companies like Salesforce, Cisco, Dell and Lenovo. Salesforce was so happy with our results that they invested in us.
          Our data scientists are not optimizing software; they are building models, big data manipulation techniques and APIs that are the core of the 6sense product. Our models inform smart-email campaigns, website personalization, ad optimization, inside sales call lists and go-to-market messaging. In all we influence how businesses spend millions in marketing and sales budgets.
