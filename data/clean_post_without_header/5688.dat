        Why Senior Quality Assurance Engineers Matter
        Our Senior Quality Assurance Engineers demonstrate experience doing both manual and automated testing. They bring both strategic vision and solid execution skills to test native mobile applications as well as web applications.

They also estimate and investigate risks of QA tasks and set expectations/goals for each project.
        In addition, they meet with client QA team members to set expectations, and report findings back to our QA work streams. They create, maintain, and execute comprehensive QA test cases based on functional specifications and/or wireframes. They report informative and detailed defects throughout the project in addition to reporting individual status during daily Scrum meetings and QA meetings. Lastly, they follow up with owned defects to assure they're to closure.
