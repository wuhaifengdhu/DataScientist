          About the Job
             AT&T now has an integrated product offering that is video, mobility and broadband.  No other business has the suite of data we have.  If you love data, we’ve got it!
             We have a dynamic team of seven people focused on customer interactions analytics—our team are the data scientists who utilize machine learning to extract actionable insights and correlations with business goals from video viewership, broadband usage and mobility usage.  Our wealth of data is useless unless we can drive significant business impact.  That’s why we need you to glean insights and communicate recommendations.  We’re a fun team who’s into both business and data.  To be successful in this role, you’ll need a balance of strong technical skills and the ability to communicate a summarized story to our Marketing team.
