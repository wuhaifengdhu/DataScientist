        The crop systems modeling scientist will develop crop models and applications that create value and improve business processes. The scientist will create novel algorithms to simulate growth and development for multiple crops and cropping systems, along with methodologies to train these models to maximize predictability of performance. Modeling and training frameworks include dynamic and Bayesian methods, and combination of mechanistic and data driven algorithms. The scientist participates and leads interdisciplinary teams of plant scientists, data scientists, software engineers and social scientists to ensure successful development of crop models through training and iterative model building, and development of applications that facilitate crop model deployment.
