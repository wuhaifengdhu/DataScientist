          The goal of every Wunderman campaign is to inspire people to take action. We’re different from other agencies because key to everything we do is proving that our strategies make a difference. We’re more than a good idea machine — we want to show clients that great strategies backed by data and executed correctly across channels have bottom-line impacts.
          We do this by starting every project, every idea, and every brainstorm with Collision – an intentional collaboration across teams to inform creative strategies that speak to users. From there we execute, test and optimize.
          To help us succeed, Wunderman Memphis is seeking Digital Business Analysts to join our growing team. Wunderman BAs turn our clever strategies into executable plans by working with project leads to define and document the important details that the team needs to take action.
           Proactively gather project requirements by translating big ideas into actionable details
           Manage / maintain requirements throughout both internal and client feedback rounds
           Constantly assess the details against the original strategy to ensure alignment
           Lead meetings with the project team to review requirements as the project transitions from phase to phase
           Detail user flows that show the team how a user will move through each campaign channel
           Document product functionality to show the teams how to set up and build the assets correctly
           Create one-page snapshots that give the team a clear picture of phases and deliverables across the project lifecycle
           Collaborate with project leads to turn high-level timelines into detailed timelines for each service line
           Work with project leads to identify individual inputs needed to produce the overall deliverables
          Overall, Wunderman BAs should constantly look for ways to streamline, automate and consolidate project documentation and processes. They are question askers, planners, big-picture thinkers, detail-oriented, process motivated, and know how to clearly communicate.
