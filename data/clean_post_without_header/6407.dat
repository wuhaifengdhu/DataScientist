        Setting up the operations for HealthTap across the world, one health system at a time.
        Healthcare is expensive and complex. Help us fix it.
        HealthTap has assembled talent to form the first growth team in digital health. Read more about how the team started here:

        Right now, we're looking for the first Growth Launcher to onboard the population of the Waikato region in New Zealand and their doctors onto the platform.
        About HealthTap
        HealthTap is the first global virtual health practice, powered by more than 100,000 U.S. doctors, delivering fast, affordable, and high-quality care.
        How does that work?
        * You can search the world's largest library (5.5 billion answers served over six years) of peer-reviewed doctor knowledge for any health topic
        * Or ask help from Dr. A.I, our virtual "physician" who translates your symptoms into personalized, doctor-recommended insights—trained by HealthTap's doctor network
        * And if needed, connect with a doctor for a live virtual consult through voice, video, or text—and get prescriptions, labs tests, and referrals afterwards
        Not only have we served more than 250 million people over the past six years, we have also partnered with the most reputable health providers and health payors -- from New Zealand to the United States -- who use our HOPES platform to help their patients receive and doctors deliver faster, more affordable, and high-quality care.
        We're a venture-backed (with the likes of Khosla, Eric Schmidt, and Mayfield Fund) health-tech startup based in the heart of Palo Alto.
        What's the opportunity?
        As part of the growth team, you'll have resources, autonomy, and the support of other A-players to onboard the people in New Zealand, and their doctors through rapid innovation and experimentation.
        You do this together with a growth product marketing manager, growth data scientist, doctors, patients, and our local partner to brainstorm, prioritize, ship, and analyze growth interventions.
        As the Launcher, you do your homework well before you set foot in New Zealand, to understand the pain points in the health system of the Waikato region, regulations, and market opportunity. As a baseline, you need to understand how New Zealand lives and breathes.
        Examples of what you could work on:
        * Develop partnerships and manage relationships with our partner Waikato District HealthBoard to help thousands of doctors to provide virtual care such as consults through their mobile phones
        * Create and execute interventions to register patients -- for example, by enrolling 10,000 students from the Waikato University
        * Form relationships with local press
        * Explore biz dev opportunities
        * Recruit, hire, and train a local team
        If you're successful your tiger team travels around the globe growing HealthTap from the ground up with our local partners, so we need the best. If that's you, get excited!
