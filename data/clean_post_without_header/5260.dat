        About Us
        Mobiquity is a rapidly scaling digital engagement player with more than 400 colleagues around the world. We envision, design, create, and optimize compelling, game-changing digital solutions across all channels (think: mobile, web, voice, and IoT), combining our strengths in strategy, data science, and engineering.
        Technology and innovation drive what we do, and human experience inspires how we do it. We not only advise our Global 2000 clients but also love to build and launch products using realistic and pragmatic strategies.
        We are hunters, nerds, thinkers, tinkerers, and true believers in creating moments that change people's lives. We are makers, designers, marketers, data scientists, and coders who take pride in what we craft. And we are bright minds who find inspiration in those moments of engagement that we deliver to millions of people every day.
        We work within a wide variety of industries and have deep expertise in sectors including healthcare, consumer, retail, communications, and financial services. We're also proud to be an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Premier Consulting Partner, as this top-tier honor is one of many qualifications that differentiates us from the rest.
        Why Our Technical Leads Matter
        Our Technical Leads are the influencers and leaders of multiple agile delivery teams. They are key participants in the delivery organization management team, overseeing the work of mobile application software developers and software quality assurance engineers across the business. Our Technical Leads take ownership of Design and User Stories supplied by UX and Architecture teams at the beginning of the project, and become the recognized expert of required feature functionality for the project. They work closely with Project Managers to maintain realistic task schedules for which all technical resources are prepared and available to meet delivery deadlines.
        Technical Leads at Mobiquity are dedicated to our clients, and harness the best of their hands on experience with leadership and model behaviors. Our Technical Leads don't get caught up in the stress of targets and deliverable deadlines, but possess the unique ability to inspire, motivate and rally their teams toward the desired goal. The Tech Lead's passion and drive to create truly innovative mobile solutions helps Mobiquity remain a top competitor in an ever-changing mobile industry, and encourages their teams to continue creating enterprise scale and quality solutions.
