        WHAT WE'RE ABOUT:
        Citi's Global Consumer Bank is embarking on a strategic initiative to take advantage of innovations in data and advanced analytic technologies to enable an insight-driven business strategy. Together with our technology partners, we are evolving our current state architecture to incorporate next generation technologies built on the Hadoop platform. We are changing our way of working by embracing Agile methodologies to accelerate our delivery and productivity. Harnessing data at the speed of real-time will enable Citi to advance our business towards a fully digital and mobile banking experience for our customers.
        We are looking for a talented senior engineer to build streaming event and data based solutions for Citi's real-time system â€“ the Event Cloud. The real-time system is the heart and soul of our future state architecture. It is responsible for capturing requests from banking transactions and customer interactions and creating relevant responses such as alerts, offers and dynamic personal experiences. Our real-time platform is central to the fabric of our next generation banking platform and builds on top of our new data capabilities. To make our real-time system more efficient and more intelligent, we need to extract deep and timely insights from our carefully curated data. We also have to make the insights easily accessible for both people and machines to consume in real time via APIs and other interfaces.
